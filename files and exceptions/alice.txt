      A golden July afternoon
      Shines so brightly,
      In clumsy little hands
      The oar stubbornly lingers,
      And the current
      carries us far from home.

      Merciless! On a hot day,
      At such a sleepy hour,
      When only to doze,
      Without opening my eyes,
      You demand that I
      Invent a story.

      And the First orders
      It to begin without delay,
      The Second asks: "
      Let there be adventures, Be more stupid."
      And the Third interrupts us
      A hundred times in an instant.

      But then silence fell,
      And, as if in a dream,
      The girl walks silently
      Through a fairytale land
      And sees many wonders
      In the underground depths.

      But the spring of fantasy has dried up -
      Its stream does not gushes.
      - I will tell you the ending later,
      I give you my word!
      - It has come later! -
      my company shouts to me.

      And the thread of my magical tale slowly stretches
      ,
      Towards sunset, the matter finally
      Reaches the denouement.
      Let's go home. The evening ray
      softened the colors of the day.

      Alice,
      keep the tale of childhood days until your hair turns gray
      in that secret place where you keep
      infantile dreams,
      as a wanderer guards a flower
      from a distant land.

Chapter I. DOWN THE RABBIT HOPE


      Alice was getting tired of sitting idle by the river-bank with her sister; she glanced once or twice at the book her sister was reading, but there were no pictures and no conversations.
      'What's the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'if there aren't any pictures and no conversations?'
      She sat wondering whether she ought to get up and pick some flowers for a wreath; her thoughts were slow and disjointed, for the heat made her sleepy. Of course, making a wreath would be very pleasant, but was it worth getting up for?
      Suddenly a rabbit with red eyes ran past.
      Of course, there was nothing surprising in that. True, the Rabbit said as he ran,
      'Oh, dear! I'm late.'
      But that didn't seem very strange to Alice. (Remembering it later, she thought she ought to have been surprised; but at the time it all seemed quite natural.) But when the Rabbit suddenly took a watch out of his waistcoat pocket, glanced at it, and ran off again, Alice jumped to her feet. It suddenly dawned on her: she'd never seen a rabbit with a watch before, much less one in a waistcoat pocket! Burning with curiosity, she ran after him across the field and only just managed to notice him dart into a hole under a hedge.
      At that very moment, Alice darted after him, not thinking about how she would get out.
      The hole ran straight ahead at first, level as a tunnel, and then suddenly dropped off steeply. Before Alice could blink, she began to fall as if into a deep well.
      Either the well was very deep, or she was falling very slowly; at least she had enough time to recover and consider what would happen next. At first she tried to see what was waiting for her below, but it was dark there, and she could not see anything. Then she began to look around. The walls of the well were lined with cupboards and bookshelves; here and there pictures and maps hung on nails. Flying past one of the shelves, she snatched up a jar of jam from it. The jar was marked "ORANGE" but alas! It was empty. Alice was afraid to throw the jar down - what if she kill someone! In flight, she managed to push it into a cupboard.
      "What a fall!" thought Alice. "Falling down the stairs will be a piece of cake for me now. And our people will think I'm terribly brave. If I fell off the roof, I wouldn't utter a peep.
      It's quite possible that it would be so.
      But she kept falling and falling. Will there really be no end to it?"
      "I wonder how many miles I've gone now?" said Alice aloud. "I suppose I'm getting nearer to the centre of the earth. Let me see... It seems about four thousand miles down."
      You see, Alice had learnt something of this sort in school-room lessons, and though it was not a proper moment to show off her knowledge, as no one could hear her, she could not help saying:
      "Yes, indeed, that is it," said Alice. "But I wonder what latitude and longitude I am in then?"
      To tell the truth, she had no idea what latitude and longitude were, but she liked the words very much. They sounded so important and impressive!
      After a pause she began again:
      "Suppose I should fly right through the earth? How funny it would be! I come out and see the people upside down! What are their names? Antipathies, I think."
      She was half glad that no one could hear her at the moment, for the word did not sound quite right.
      "I shall have to ask them the name of their country." "Excuse me, madam, where am I?" In Australia or New Zealand?''
      And she tried to curtsy. Can you imagine curtsying in the air while falling? How do you think you could do it?
      -- But she'll think I'm terribly ignorant, of course! No, I won't ask anyone! Maybe I'll see an inscription somewhere!
      And she kept falling and falling. There's nothing to do -- after a pause, Alice spoke again.
      -- Dinah will be looking for me all evening. She's so bored without me!
      Dinah was their cat's name.
      -- I hope they won't forget to give her some milk this afternoon... Oh, Dinah, my dear, what a pity you're not with me. True, there are no mice in the air, but there are plenty of midges! I wonder if cats eat midges?
      Then Alice felt her eyes were closing. She muttered sleepily:
      -- Do cats eat midges? Do cats eat midges?
      Sometimes she would say:
      "Do midges eat cats?"
      Alice did not know the answer to either question, and so it made no difference to her how she asked them. She felt herself falling asleep. She already dreamed that she was walking arm in arm with Dinah and asking her anxiously:
      "Confess, Dinah, have you ever eaten midges?"
      Then there was a terrible crash. Alice fell onto a heap of brushwood and dry leaves.
      She was not in the least hurt and quickly jumped to her feet. She looked up - it was dark there. Another corridor stretched before her, and at the end of it she saw the White Rabbit. There was not a minute to lose, and Alice ran after him. She heard the Rabbit say as he disappeared around the corner:
      "Oh, my whiskers! Oh, my ears! How late I am!
      " Having turned the corner, Alice expected to see the Rabbit immediately, but he was nowhere to be seen. And she found herself in a long, low hall, illuminated by a row of lamps hanging from the ceiling.
      There were many doors in the hall, but they were all locked. Alice tried opening them, first on one side and then on the other, but finding that none of them would open, she walked down the hall, sadly wondering how she could get out of there.
      Suddenly she saw a glass table with three legs. There was nothing on it except a tiny golden key. Alice decided that this was the key to one of the doors, but alas! either the keyholes were too big, or the key was too small, for it would not fit any of the doors, try as she might. Walking down the hall a second time, Alice saw a curtain which she had not noticed before, and behind it was a small door about fifteen inches high. Alice put the key into the keyhole, and, to her great joy, it fit!
      She opened the door and saw behind it a very narrow hole, no wider than a rat's hole. Alice knelt down and looked in – at the end of it she could see a garden of amazing beauty. Oh, how she longed to get out of the dark hall and wander among the bright flower beds and cool fountains! But she could not even get her head into the hole.
      “Even if my head got through,” thought poor Alice, “what’s the use! Who needs a head without shoulders? Oh, why can’t I fold up like a telescope! If I only knew where to begin, I’m sure I could.”
      You see, so many wonderful things had happened that day that nothing seemed impossible to her now.
      There was no point in sitting by the little door, and Alice returned to the glass table, vaguely hoping to find another key on it, or, at worst, a manual for folding it up like a telescope. However, this time there was a bottle on the table.
      “I’m quite sure it wasn’t here before!” " said Alice to herself.
      There was a piece of paper tied round the neck of the bottle, and on the paper, in large, pretty letters, was written, `DRINK ME!'
      This was very nice, of course, but clever Alice was in no hurry to follow the advice.
      "First of all, you must make sure that this bottle isn't marked 'Poison!' anywhere on it," she said.
      You see, she had read all sorts of charming stories about children being burned alive, or eaten by wild animals, and all these unpleasant things happened to them because they wouldn't observe the simple rules their friends had taught them: if you hold a red-hot poker in your hand too long, you'll burn yourself in the end; if you cut your finger too deeply with a knife, your finger will usually bleed; if you drain a bottle marked 'Poison!' at one go, you're almost sure to feel ill sooner or later. Alice remembered the last rule firmly.
      But this bottle was unmarked, and Alice ventured to take a sip. It tasted very good, like cherry pie, pineapple, roast turkey, fudge, and hot buttered toast. She drank it all down.

      * * * * *

      "What a queer sensation!" cried Alice. "I suppose I'm shrinking like a telescope."
      And she was right, for she was only ten inches tall now. She thought she could easily walk through the little door into the lovely garden, and was very glad. But first, just to be on the safe side, she waited a little to make sure that she was not getting any smaller. This worried her a little.
      "If I go on getting smaller like this," she said to herself, "I shall disappear altogether. Burn out like a candle! I wonder what I'll be like then?"
      And she tried to imagine what a candle flame looked like after it went out. As far as she remembered, she had never seen anything like it.
      After waiting a little and making sure that nothing else was happening, she decided to go out into the garden at once. Poor thing! When she went to the door, she discovered that she had forgotten the golden key on the table, and when she returned to the table, she realized that she could not reach it now. Through the glass she could clearly see the key lying on the table from below. She tried to climb onto the table along the glass leg, but the leg was very slippery. Tired of futile efforts, poor Alice sat down on the floor and began to cry.
      “Now, that’s enough!” she sternly ordered herself a little later. “Crying won’t help your grief. I advise you to stop this instant!”
      She always gave herself good advice, although she seldom followed it. Sometimes she scolded herself so mercilessly that her eyes filled with tears. And once she even tried to spank herself for cheating while playing a game of croquet by herself. The silly girl was very fond of pretending to be two different girls at once.
      “But it’s impossible now, even with the best will in the world!” thought poor Alice. “I’m barely enough for one!”
      Then she saw a little glass box under the glass. Alice opened it - there was a pie inside, with the words “EAT ME!” written beautifully on it in currants.
      “Well,” said Alice, “I’ll do just that. If it makes me grow, I’ll get the key, and if I become smaller, I’ll squeeze under the door. If I only want to get into the garden, it doesn’t matter how!”
      She took a bite of the pie and thought anxiously:
      “Growing or getting smaller? Growing or getting smaller?”
      Alice placed her hand on the top of her head to feel what was happening. But, to her great surprise, she grew neither taller nor shorter. Of course, that's always the case when you eat pie, but Alice had become accustomed to only the most amazing things happening around her; it seemed dull and stupid to her that life had returned to its usual routine. She took another bite and soon ate the whole pie.
Chapter II. THE SEA OF TEAR


Fig. 1


      --Curiouser and curiouser! -- cried Alice. She was so amazed that she had quite forgotten how to speak. -- I'm spreading out like a telescope now. Good-bye, legs.
      (At that moment she glanced at her legs and saw them rushing down. Another moment and they would be out of sight.)
      --My poor legs! Who will put your shoes on now? Who will put your stockings and shoes on you? And I won't be able to reach you now, my dears. We shall be so far apart that I won't have time for you at all... You'll have to do without me.
      Here she became thoughtful.
      --I must be kinder to them, after all, -- she said to herself. -- Otherwise they'll go the wrong way. Oh, well! I'll send them new boots for Christmas.
      And she began to make plans.
      --I'll have to send them by messenger, -- she thought. --That will be funny! Presents for your own feet! And what a queer address!

      ``The Rug
      (near the Grate)
      To Mrs. Right Foot
      - With Alice's compliments!''

      - ``What nonsense am I talking!''
      At that moment she hit her head on the ceiling: she had stretched herself out to at least nine feet. Then she snatched up the golden key from the table and ran to the garden door.
      Poor Alice! How could she get through the door now? She only managed to peep into the garden with one eye - and that she had to lie down on the floor to do. There was no hope of getting into the hole. She sat down on the floor and burst into tears again.
      ``For shame,'' said Alice to herself after a while. ``Such a big girl (she was right about that, of course) - and you are crying! Stop it at once, do you hear?''
      But the tears flowed in streams, and soon there was a big puddle around her, about four inches deep. The water spilled over the floor and had already reached the middle of the hall. A little later, the patter of little feet was heard in the distance. Alice hastily wiped her eyes and began to wait. It was the White Rabbit returning. He was dressed in his best clothes, holding a pair of kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other. As he ran, he muttered quietly:
      “Oh, my God, what will the Duchess say! She’ll be furious if I’m late! Absolutely furious!”
      Alice was in such despair that she was ready to turn to anyone for help. When the Rabbit reached her, she whispered timidly:
      “Forgive me, sir...”
      The Rabbit jumped up, dropped his gloves and fan, darted away and immediately disappeared into the darkness.
      Alice picked up the fan and gloves. The hall was hot, and she began to fan herself.
      “Oh, just think!” she said. “What a strange day today! And yesterday everything was just as usual! Perhaps I have changed overnight? Let me think; this morning, when I got up, it was I, or it wasn’t I. It seems I’m not quite myself anymore! But if that’s so, then who am I? It’s so complicated...”
      And she began to go over in her mind her friends who were the same age as herself. Perhaps she had turned into one of them?
      “At least I’m not Ada!” she said decisively. “Her hair is curly, and mine isn’t! And I’m certainly not Mabel. I know so much, and she knows nothing at all! And anyway, she is she, and I am I! How incomprehensible it all is! Let me see if I remember what I knew or not. So it’s like this: four times five is twelve, four times six is ​​thirteen, four times seven... So I’ll never get to twenty!” Well, never mind the multiplication table! I'll try geography! London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome... No, it's all wrong, it's all wrong! I must have turned into Mabel... I'll try reading ``How precious...''
      She folded her hands on her knees, as if she were reciting a lesson, and began. But her voice sounded somehow strange, as if someone else was hoarsely pronouncing completely different words for her: How precious       the little crocodile /

      How precious his tail /       He purrs and flutters over the sand       / Diligently foams the Nile!       How skillfully he moves       / His neat claw! /       How he thanks the fishes /       Swallowing them whole!       -- The words are quite wrong! -- said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again. -- So I am Mabel after all! Now I will have to live in this old house. And I will have no toys at all! But then there will be lessons to be learned forever. Well, it is settled: if I am Mabel, I will stay here for ever. Let them try and come here for me! They will hang their heads down and call: “Come up, my dear, to us!” And I will only look at them and answer: “Tell me first who I am! If I like it, I will come up, and if not, I will stay here until I am changed into someone else!”       Then the tears sprang to her eyes.       “Why does no one come for me? How tired I am of sitting here alone!”       With these words Alice looked down, and, to her surprise, noticed that as she spoke she had pulled the Rabbit’s tiny glove over one hand.       “How did I manage that?” thought Alice. “I must be getting smaller again.”













      Alice got up and went to the table to find out how tall she was now. She couldn't have been more than two feet tall, and was getting smaller and smaller. She soon realized that the fan she was holding was to blame, and she threw it down on the floor. It was a good thing she did, or she might have vanished altogether!
      "Oh! I've barely escaped!" said Alice, frightened by the sudden change, but glad to be safe. "And now, into the garden!"
      And she ran to the door. But alas! The door was locked again, and the golden key was still lying on the glass table.
      "It gets worse by the hour!" thought poor Alice. "I'm the smallest I've ever been! My situation is bad! It couldn't be worse..."
      Then she slipped and - splash! - fell into the water. The water tasted salty and came up to her chin. At first she thought she must have fallen into the sea somehow.
      'Then,' she thought, 'I might as well go by rail.'
      Alice had only been to the seaside once in her life, and so it all seemed the same to her: the bathing-huts in the sea, the little children building sand-castles with wooden spades on the shore; then the boarding-houses, and beyond them the railway station.
      Presently, however, she realized that she had fallen into a pool of tears, the same ones she had cried when she was nine feet tall.
      'Oh, why did I cry so much?' thought Alice, swimming round and round, trying to find out which way the shore was. 'It would be silly of me to drown in my own tears! Serves me right! Of course, that would be very strange! But everything is strange today!'
      Then she heard a splashing sound not far off, and she swam towards it to find out who was splashing there. At first she thought it was a walrus or a hippopotamus, but then she remembered how tiny she was, and, looking closer, saw that it was only a mouse, which had apparently fallen into the water too.
      'Should I speak to it?' thought Alice. 'Everything is so strange today that perhaps it can talk too! At any rate, it's worth trying!'
      And she began:
      'Oh, Mouse! Do you know how to get out of this puddle? I'm so tired of swimming here, Oh, Mouse!'
      Alice thought that was the proper way to address mice. She had no experience of it, but she remembered her brother's Latin grammar.

      ``Nominative Mouse,
      Genitive Mouses,
      Dative Mouses,
      Accusative Mouse,
      Vocative Mouse!''

      The Mouse looked at her in bewilderment, and winked at her slightly (at least, so it seemed to Alice), but did not say a word in reply.
      “Perhaps she doesn’t understand English?” thought Alice. “What if she’s French by birth? She came here with William the Conqueror…”
      Although Alice was proud of her knowledge of history, she did not have a very clear idea of ​​what had happened when.
      And she began again:
      “Ou’ est ma chatte?” (1)
      In the French textbook this phrase was first.
      The Mouse rushed out of the water and trembled all over with horror.
      “Forgive me!” said Alice quickly, seeing that she had offended the poor animal. “I forgot that you don’t like cats.
      ” “Don’t like cats?” cried the Mouse shrilly. “Would you like them if you were in my place?
      ” “I suppose not,” Alice tried to reassure her. “Please don’t be angry! It’s a pity I can’t show you our Dinah. If you only saw her, I think you would like cats.” "She's so sweet, so calm," Alice continued thoughtfully, lazily floating in the salt water. "She sits by the fireplace, purrs and washes herself. And so soft, I just want to stroke her! And how she catches mice!.. Oh, forgive me! Please forgive me!"
(1) Where is my cat? (French)


      The Mouse's fur stood on end. Alice knew that she had offended her deeply.
      "If you don't like it, we won't talk about it any more," said Alice.
      "We won't?" cried the Mouse, trembling from head to tip of tail. "You'd think I started this conversation! We've always hated cats in our family. Low, nasty, vulgar creatures! I don't want to hear about them!
      " "Very well, very well!" said Alice, hastening to change the subject. "And... do you like dogs? "
      The Mouse said nothing.
      "We have such a nice little doggie next door!" Alice went on happily. "I should love to introduce you to him! He's a little terrier! His eyes are shiny, and his fur is brown, long and wavy! If you throw him anything, he carries it back at once, and then he sits on his hind legs and begs for a bone!" What doesn’t he do – I can’t remember everything! His owner is a farmer, he says: this dog is priceless! He killed all the rats in the district and all the mice ... Oh, my dear! - Alice said sadly. - I think I’ve offended him again!
      The Mouse swam away from her with all its might, even making waves on the water.
      - My dear Mouse! - Alice cried tenderly after her. - Please, come back. If you don’t like cats and dogs, I will not say another word about them.
      Hearing this, the Mouse turned around and slowly swam back. She turned terribly pale. (``With anger!'' - thought Alice.)
      - Let’s get out on the shore, - said the Mouse in a quiet, trembling voice, - and I will tell you my story. Then you will understand why I hate cats and dogs.
      And really it was necessary to get out. The puddle was becoming increasingly crowded with all the birds and animals that had fallen into it. There was Robin Goose, Dodo, Lorikeet, Ed the Eaglet, and all sorts of other amazing creatures. Alice swam forward, and everyone followed her to the shore.
Chapter III. Running in Circles and a Long Story


      The company assembled on the bank presented a rather unsightly appearance: the birds' feathers were ruffled, the animals' fur was soaking wet. Water was pouring off them in streams, and everyone felt cold and uncomfortable.
      The first thing, of course, was to decide how to dry off as quickly as possible. They began to hold a council. Before a few minutes had passed, Alice felt as if she had known them all for a century. She even argued with the Lory Parrot, who sulked and kept repeating:
      "I'm older than you, and I know better than you!"
      Alice demanded that he tell her how old he was, but the Parrot firmly refused. That was the end of the argument.
      At last the Mouse, to whom everyone treated with respect, cried out:
      "Sit down, everyone sit down and listen. I'll dry you in a jiffy!"
      Everyone obediently sat down in a circle, and the Mouse stood in the middle. Alice kept her eyes fixed on her, knowing that if she did not dry out at once she would catch a bad cold.
      - Cough-cough! - the Mouse cleared her throat with an important air. - Is everyone ready? Then let's begin. This will dry you out in a jiffy! Silence! "William the Conqueror, with the Pope's blessing, quickly achieved the complete subjugation of the Anglo-Saxons, who needed firm power and had seen many unfair seizures of the throne and lands in their time. Edwin, Earl of Mercia, and Morcar, Earl of Northumbria..." -
      "Y-yes!" said the Parrot and shuddered.
      - Excuse me, - asked the Mouse, frowning with excessive politeness, - did you say something?
      - No, no, - the Parrot answered hastily.
      - Then it seemed to me, - noted the Mouse. - So, I continue. ``Edwin, Earl of Mercia, and Morcar, Earl of Northumbria, supported William the Conqueror, and even Stigand, Archbishop of Canterbury, thought it prudent...'' `
      `What did he find?'' asked Robin Goose.
      ``...found it,'' answered the Mouse. ``Don't you know what it is?''
      ``Of course I do,'' answered Robin Goose. ``When I find anything, it's usually a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the Archbishop find?''
      The Mouse did not deign to answer him, but went on hurriedly:
      ``...found it prudent, and decided to go with Edgar the Ætheling to William and offer him the crown. William behaved very reservedly at first, but the insolence of his Norman warriors...'' Well, my dear, are you drying up? -- she asked Alice.
      "I'm just pouring," Alice replied sadly. "I'm not going to dry up!
      " "In that case," declared the Dodo, "I propose that we pass a resolution to dissolve the meeting immediately, so that the most urgent measures can be taken to speed up..."
      "Speak like a normal person," said Ed the Eaglet. "I don't know half the words! And I don't think you understand them yourself."
      And the Eaglet turned away to hide his smile. The birds giggled quietly.
      "What I meant," said the Dodo, offended, "was that we should have a Circle Run. Then we'll be dry in no time!
      " "What is that?" asked Alice.
      To tell the truth, she was not very interested in it, but the Dodo was significantly silent - apparently waiting for a question. And since no one else was silent either, Alice had to ask.
      "Rather than explain," said the Dodo, "it's better to show!"
      (Perhaps you would like to play this game some winter? In that case, I'll tell you what the Dodo did.)
      First he drew a circle on the ground. True, the circle was not very even, but the Dodo said:
      "The correctness of the shape is not important!"
      Then he placed everyone in a circle, without any order. No one gave any commands - everyone ran whenever they wanted. It was difficult to understand how and when this competition was supposed to end. Half an hour later, when everyone had run enough and dried off, the Dodo suddenly shouted:
      - The race is over!
      Everyone crowded around him and, breathing heavily, began to ask:
      - Who has won?
      Dodo could not answer this question without thinking carefully. He froze in place, putting his finger to his forehead (this is the pose they usually use to portray Shakespeare, remember?), and plunged into thought. And everyone stood around and waited in silence. At last the Dodo said:
      - Everyone is a winner! And everyone will get a reward!
      - And who will give them out? - everyone asked in chorus.
      - She, of course, - answered the Dodo, pointing his finger at Alice.
      Everyone surrounded Alice and vied with each other in shouting:
      - Rewards! Rewards! Give out the rewards!
      Alice was at a loss. In her confusion she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a packet of candied peels.
      (Luckily, her tears had not soaked them.) She distributed them among the assembled company, each one a candied peel, just enough.
      “But she deserves a reward too,” said the Mouse.
      “Of course,” said the Dodo gravely.
      And, turning to Alice, he asked:
      “Have you anything left in your pocket?
      ” “No,” answered Alice sadly. “Only a thimble.
      ” “Give it here!” ordered the Dodo.
      At this everyone crowded around Alice again, and the Dodo solemnly handed her the thimble and said:
      “We beg you to accept this dainty thimble as a reward!”
      This short speech was greeted with general applause.
      Alice thought the whole ceremony very funny, but everyone looked so serious that she did not dare laugh. She wanted to reply to the Dodo’s speech, but she could not think of anything to say, so she just bowed primly and took the thimble.
      Everyone began to eat. A terrible noise and commotion arose. The large birds swallowed their candied peel in a flash and began to complain that they had not even had time to taste it. And the smaller birds got the candied peel stuck in their throats - they had to pat them on the back. At last everyone had eaten, sat down in a circle again and asked the Mouse to tell them something else.
      “You promised to tell us your story,” said Alice. “And why do you hate ... K and S.”
      She said the last phrase in a whisper, afraid lest she offend the Mouse again.
      “It’s a very long and sad story,” began the Mouse with a sigh.
      After a pause, she suddenly shrieked:
      - You scoundrel!
      - About a tail? - repeated Alice in bewilderment and looked at her tail. - A sad story about a tail?
      And while the Mouse was talking, Alice could not understand what this had to do with a mouse's tail. So the story that the Mouse told looked like this in her imagination:

      Scratch-scratch
      said to the mouse
      : Well, that's the way
      it is
      , you and I will
      go
      to court,
      I
      will sue you.
      And don't you dare
      deny it,
      we must
      get even,
      because       I've been sitting around doing nothing
      all morning       .       And to this       impudent       mouse the following       answer:       Without a trial       and without an       investigation,       sir,       they don't do cases. -       I am both the court       and the       investigation, -       Scratch-scratch       answers her       . - I       sentence       you to       death       .       Then       you'll       be       kaput       .       - You're not listening! -- the Mouse said sternly to Alice.       -- No, why not? -- Alice answered modestly. -- You have reached the fifth curl already, haven't you?       -- Nonsense! -- the Mouse was angry. -- Always all sorts of nonsense! How tired I am of it! It's simply unbearable!       -- What is there to bear? -- asked Alice. (She was always ready to oblige.) -- Let me help!































      “Not a chance!” said the Mouse, offended, and she stood up and walked away. “You’re talking nonsense! You’re probably trying to insult me!
      ” “What are you saying?” Alice objected. “I never meant to! You’re just always taking offense.”
      The Mouse only growled in response.
      “Please don’t go!” Alice called after her. “Finish your story!”
      And everyone supported her in chorus:
      “Yes, yes, don’t go!”
      But the Mouse only shook her head impatiently and ran faster.
      “What a pity she didn’t want to stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as she was out of sight.
      And the old Medusa said to her daughter:
      “Oh, my dear, let this serve as a lesson to you! One must always control oneself!
      ” “You’d better hold your tongue, mummy,” answered the young Medusa with slight irritation. “It’s not for you to talk about that. You’d make an oyster lose its patience!
      ” “I wish our Dinah were here!” Alice said loudly, without addressing anyone in particular. “She’d bring her back in a flash!
      ” “May I ask you: who is this Dinah?” asked the Laurie.
      Alice was always glad to talk about her favorite pet.
      “It’s our cat,” she answered readily. “You can’t even imagine how she catches mice! And how she grabs birds! She swallowed them in a flash, without even leaving a bone!”
      This speech made a deep impression on those present. The birds hurried home. Old Magpie began to wrap herself in her shawl.
      “I’ll go home!” she said. “The night air is bad for my throat.”
      And the Canary began to call to her children in a trembling voice:
      “Come home, my dears! It’s high time you were in bed!
      ” Soon, under various pretexts, everyone went home, and Alice was left alone.
      “Why did I even mention Dinah?” Alice thought sadly. “Nobody likes her here! And yet you couldn’t find a nicer cat! Oh, Dinah, my dear! Will I ever see you again or not?”
      Here poor Alice began to cry again – she felt so sad and lonely.
      A little later she heard the light sound of footsteps again. She looked around. Perhaps it was the Mouse who had stopped being angry and had come to finish her story?
Chapter IV. Bill goes down the drain


      But it was the White Rabbit. He was trotting slowly back, looking around anxiously, as if he were looking for something. Alice heard him muttering to himself:
      “Oh, Duchess! Duchess! My poor paws! My poor whiskers! She’s going to have me executed! I bet she is! Where did I lose them?”
      Alice immediately guessed that he was looking for his fan and white gloves, and she began to look for them, wanting to help him out of the kindness of her heart. But the fan and the gloves were nowhere to be found. Everything around had changed - the large room with the glass table and the little door had disappeared somewhere, as if it had never been there.
      Soon the Rabbit noticed Alice.
      “Hey, Mary Ann,” he cried angrily, “what are you doing here? Run home quickly and bring me a pair of gloves and a fan! Do hurry!”
      Alice was so frightened that she ran off to do the errand as fast as she could. She did not even try to explain to the Rabbit that he had made a mistake.
      “He must have taken me for a housemaid,” she thought as she ran. “He’ll be surprised when he finds out who I am! All the same, I’ll take him the gloves and fan, if I can only find them!”
      At that moment she saw a neat little house. On the door was a brass plate, polished until it shone, and on the plate was written: “B. RABBIT.”
      Alice went in without knocking and ran up the stairs. She was very afraid of meeting the real Mary Ann. Of course, Mary Ann would simply turn her out of the house, and then she would not be able to take the fan and gloves to
      the Rabbit. “How strange that I should be the Rabbit’s errand boy!” thought Alice. “The last thing I need is Dinah giving me errands!”
      And she began to invent ways how this could happen.
      -- ``Miss Alice! Come here quickly! It's time for a walk, and you're not dressed yet!'' -- ``Right away, nurse! I must watch the mouse-hole until Dinah comes back. She told me to be careful the mouse doesn't run away!'' However, Dinah would probably be turned out if she gave such orders!
      Thinking thus, she made her way into a small room, sparkling with cleanliness. By the window stood a table, and on it, as she hoped, lay a fan and several pairs of tiny gloves. Alice took the fan and a pair of gloves and was just about to leave the room, when she suddenly saw a small bottle near the looking-glass. It did not have ``DRINK ME!'' written on it, but Alice opened it and put it to her lips.
      ``Whenever I swallow anything,'' she thought, ``something interesting always happens.'' We'll see what happens this time! I'd really like to grow up again. I'm tired of being such a tiny thing!
      And so it happened – and much faster than Alice expected. Before she'd even finished half of it, her head hit the ceiling. She had to duck to avoid breaking her neck. She quickly set the bottle down on the table.
      “Well, that’s enough,” she said. “I hope I’ll stop there. I won’t be able to fit through the door as it is. Why did I have to drink so much!
      Alas!” it was too late, she was still growing and growing. She had to get down on her knees, and a minute later even that was not enough. She lay down, bending one arm at the elbow (her arm reached the very door), and clasping her head with the other. A minute later she felt cramped again - she continued to grow. She had to put one arm out of the window and put one leg up the chimney.
      There was nowhere else to grow.
      “There’s nothing more I can do, no matter what happens,” she said to herself. “What will happen to me?”
      But, fortunately, the effect of the magic potion ended there. She did not grow anymore. True, this did not make her feel any better. There was no particular hope of salvation, and it is no wonder that she became sad.
      “How nice it was at home!” thought poor Alice. “I was always the same height there! And mice and rabbits were no authority to me. Why did I ever climb into this rabbit hole! And yet... and yet... I like this life—everything here is so unusual! I wonder what has happened to me? When I read fairy tales, I firmly believed that such things could not happen in the world! And now I’ve found myself in them myself! I should write a book about me, a big, good book. When I grow up, I’ll write...”
      Here Alice fell silent and added sadly:
      “Yes, but I’ve grown up already... At least here I have nowhere else to grow.
      ” “But what if I stop there?” thought Alice. “Perhaps that’s not bad—then I won’t grow old! Only, I’ll have to study my lessons all my life. No, I don’t want to!
      ” “Oh, how silly you are, Alice!” she objected to herself. “How can I study my lessons here?” You yourself have hardly enough room... Where will you put your books?
      So she talked and argued with herself, taking one side and then the other. The conversation was turning out to be very interesting, but then someone’s voice was heard under the windows. She stopped and listened.
      “Mary-Ann! Mary-Ann!” cried the voice. “Bring me the gloves! And hurry up!”
      Then there was a patter of little feet on the stairs. Alice realized that it was the Rabbit looking for her, and, forgetting that she was now a thousand times bigger than he was and that she had nothing to be afraid of, she trembled so much that the whole house shook.
      The Rabbit went to the door and pushed at it with his paw. But the door opened into a room, and as Alice rested her elbow on it, it did not give way. Alice heard the Rabbit say:
      “Well, I’ll go round the house and climb in at the window...
      ” “Oh, no!” thought Alice.
      She waited until she thought he was coming to the window, then put out her hand at random and tried to catch hold of him. There was a shout, a thud, and the sound of breaking glass. He must have fallen into the hothouses where they grew cucumbers.
      Then there was an angry shout.
      "Pat! Pat!" cried the Rabbit. "Where are you?"
      And a voice Alice had never heard before answered:
      "Here I am! Digging for apples, your honor!
      " "Digging for apples!" said the Rabbit angrily. "What a waste of time! You had better help me out of here!"
      There was another sound of breaking glass.
      "Tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?
      " "A hand, of course, your honor!"
      (He pronounced the last two words as one, so that it sounded something like `your honor!')
      "What kind of hand is that? Did you ever see such a hand before?" She could hardly get in through the window!
      -- Of course she did, your Honor! Only that hand!
      -- It's no place for it, anyway! Go and take it away, Pat!
      There was a long silence, only from time to time a whisper was heard:
      -- Your Honor, my heart isn't in it... Don't, your Honor! I beg you...
      -- You coward! Do as you're told!
      Here Alice moved her fingers in the air again. This time there were two screams. And again the glass fell.
      -- What big greenhouses there are! -- thought Alice. -- I wonder what they'll do now! ``Take it away, Pat!'' I'd be glad to get out of here myself! If only they would help me!
      She waited a little longer, but all was quiet. A little later there was the creaking of wheels and the hum of voices. There were many of them, and they were all talking at once.
      -- Where's the second ladder?
      -- I was only supposed to bring one. Bill will bring the second one!
      -- Hey, Bill! Bring it here!
      -- Put them down from this corner!
      -- We must tie them up first! They don’t even reach the middle!
      -- They will reach it, don’t be afraid!
      -- Hey, Bill! Catch the rope!
      -- Will the roof hold?
      -- Be careful! This tile is loose...
      -- It’s broken! It’s falling!
      -- Watch your heads!
      A loud crack was heard.
      -- Now, who did this?
      -- I think it was Bill!
      -- Who will climb down the chimney?
      -- I won’t climb! You climb!
      -- Oh no! Not for any amount of money!
      -- Let Bill climb!
      -- Hey, Bill! Do you hear? The master tells you to climb!
      --Oh, so that's it! -- said Alice to herself. -- So Bill has to do it? They all blame him! I wouldn't be in his place for anything. The fireplace here isn't very big, of course, and I can't swing very hard, but I can still kick him!
      Alice put her foot further into the fireplace and waited. At last she heard a rustling and scratching sound in the chimney just above her (she couldn't guess what kind of animal it was).
      -- Here comes Bill! -- she said to herself, and kicked as hard as she could. -- I wonder what will happen now!
      First she heard everyone shouting,
      -- Bill! Bill! There goes Bill!
      Then the Rabbit's voice:
      -- There, there, by the bushes! Catch him!
      Then there was silence, and then excited voices again:
      -- Hold on to your head!
      -- Give him some brandy!
      -- Not in that voice...
      -- Well, old man?
      -- What was it, old man?
      -- Tell me what happened, old man?
      At last a thin, weak voice was heard. (``That's Bill,'' thought Alice.)
      -- I don't know... Thank you, no more. I feel better already... But I can't collect my thoughts. I feel something gave me a push from below - and bam into the sky, like a firecracker!
      -- Yes, like a firecracker! -- the others took up the voice.
      -- We must burn the house! -- said the Rabbit suddenly.
      Alice shouted at the top of her voice:
      -- If you try, I'll set Dinah on you!
      There was a dead silence at once.
      -- I wonder what they'll do now? -- thought Alice. -- If they had any sense, they'd take the roof off!
      In a minute or two there was movement below again. Alice heard the Rabbit say:
      -- One barrow will do to begin with.
      "What wheelbarrows?" thought Alice.
      She was not puzzled for long. The next minute a shower of small pebbles began to rain down on her at the window. Some hit her right in the face.
      "I'll make it stop now," thought Alice.
      "Stop it!" she shouted at the top of her voice. "Or it will be worse!"
      There was dead silence again.
      Meanwhile, Alice noticed with surprise that the pebbles, as soon as they fell on the floor, immediately turned into pies. Then an idea occurred to Alice.
      "If I eat a pie," she thought, "something will definitely happen to me. I have nowhere else to grow, so most likely I will become smaller!"
      She swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she had become smaller. As soon as she had become small enough to pass through the door, she ran out of the house and saw a whole crowd of birds and little animals under the windows. In the middle of the house, poor Bill the Lizard was lying on the ground; two guinea-pigs were supporting his head and giving him something to drink from a bottle. When they saw Alice, they all ran towards her, but she took to her heels and soon found herself in a dense forest.
      “First of all, I must change my appearance,” said Alice, making her way among the trees. “And then I must find my way to that lovely garden. That’s what I’ll do – I can’t think of a better plan!”
      And indeed, it was a wonderful plan – so simple and clear. The only trouble was that Alice had not the slightest idea how to carry it out. She was peering anxiously into the thicket, when suddenly someone barked loudly right overhead. She started and looked up.
      The giant puppy looked at her with huge round eyes and quietly stretched out his paw, trying to touch her.
      "Poor little thing!" Alice said ingratiatingly and tried to whistle to him, but her lips were trembling, and the whistle didn't come out. What if the puppy is hungry? He might eat it, no matter how much she fawned!
      Alice bent down, picked up a stick from the ground and, without realizing what she was doing, held it out to the puppy. The puppy squealed with joy, jumped into the air with all his paws and grabbed the stick. Alice dodged and hid behind a thistle bush, afraid that the puppy would trample her in his joy. As soon as she appeared from behind the bush, the puppy rushed at the stick again, but misjudged his strength and went tumbling head over heels. Playing with him, thought Alice, was like playing with a cart-horse – you might get crushed under his hooves at any moment! Alice darted behind the thistles again. But the puppy couldn’t tear itself away from the stick: it ran away further, rushed at her with a hoarse bark, and then ran away again. At last it got tired and, panting, sat down at a distance, its tongue hanging out and its huge eyes half-closed.
      It was the perfect time to sneak away. Alice did not waste a minute. She ran until she was completely out of breath from fatigue and the barking of the splinter died away in the distance. Then she stopped and, leaning against the stem of a buttercup, began to fan herself with a leaf.
      “And what a lovely puppy!” said Alice thoughtfully. “I could teach it all sorts of tricks if… if only I were the right size!” Oh, by the way, I almost forgot – I need to grow up some more! Let me remember how it's done? If I'm not mistaken, you need to eat or drink something. But what?
      And indeed, what? Alice looked around at the flowers and grass, but saw nothing suitable. Nearby stood a mushroom - a large one, almost as tall as she. She looked behind it, under it, and on either side of it. Then it occurred to her that, if it came to that, she might as well see if it had anything on its cap.
      She stood on tiptoe, peered up - and met the eyes of a huge blue caterpillar. It was sitting with its arms folded across its chest, languidly smoking a hookah, paying no attention to what was going on around it.
Chapter V. The Blue Caterpillar Gives Advice


Fig. 2


      Alice and the Blue Caterpillar looked at each other for a long time without speaking. At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and spoke slowly, as if half asleep.
      “Who... are you?” asked the Blue Caterpillar.
      It was not a very conducive beginning to conversation.
      “I really don’t know now, madam,” answered Alice timidly. “I know who I was this morning when I woke up, but I’ve changed several times since then.
      ” “What are you making up?” asked the Caterpillar sternly. “Are you mad?
      ” “I don’t know,” answered Alice. “I must be in someone else’s. You see—”
      “I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.
      “I’m afraid I can’t explain it all to you,” said Alice politely. “I don’t understand it myself. So many transformations in one day would baffle anyone.”
      "It won't," said the Caterpillar.
      "You haven't experienced it before, I suppose," said Alice. "But when you have to turn into a chrysalis, and then into a butterfly, it will seem strange to you too.
      " "Not at all!" said the Caterpillar.
      "Well, perhaps," said Alice. "I only know it would seem strange to me.
      " "You!" repeated the Caterpillar, scornfully. "Who are you?"
      This brought them back to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little angry at the way the Caterpillar spoke to her. She drew herself up and said, trying to make her voice sound authoritative,
      "I think you ought to tell me who you are first.
      " "Why?" asked the Caterpillar.
      The question put Alice in her place. She could think of nothing to say, and the Caterpillar seemed very cross, so she turned and walked away.
      "Come back!" -- the Caterpillar called after her. -- I have something very important to tell you.
      It sounded tempting -- Alice returned.
      -- Pull yourself together! -- said the Caterpillar.
      -- Is that all? -- asked Alice, trying not to look angry.
      -- No, -- answered the Caterpillar.
      Alice decided to wait -- anyway, she had nothing better to do, and what if the Caterpillar still told her something worthwhile? At first the Caterpillar sucked on the hookah for a long time, but at last she took it out of her mouth and said:
      -- So, in your opinion, you have changed?
      -- Yes, madam, -- answered Alice, -- and it is very sad. I am changing all the time, and I don’t remember anything.
      -- Don’t remember what? -- asked the Caterpillar.
      -- I tried to read ``How to Cherish Every Day...'', but it turned out something quite different, -- Alice said sadly.
      -- Read ``Father William,'' -- suggested the Caterpillar.
      Alice folded her hands and began:

      - Father William, - said the curious little boy, -
      Your head is white.
      Yet you always stand upside down.
      Do you think that is right?

      - In my early youth, - the old man said in response, -
      I was afraid to throw my brains out,
      But, having learned that there are no brains in my head,
      I calmly stand upside down.

      - You are an old man, - continued the curious youth, -
      I noted this fact at the beginning.
      How is it that you so deftly performed, father,
      A triple somersault?

      - In my early youth, - the old man answered his son, -
      I rubbed myself with a special ointment,
      A bank for two shillings - one zolotnik,
      Here, won't you buy a bank to try?

      - You are not young, - said the inquisitive son, -
      You have lived nearly a hundred years.
      Meanwhile, two geese at dinner alone
      You destroyed from beak to paws.

      -- In my early youth
      I trained the muscles of my jaws by studying law,
      And I have argued with my wife so often
      That I have learned to chew well!

      -- My father, will you forgive me, in spite
      of the awkwardness of this question:
      How did you manage to keep a live eel
      Balanced on the tip of your nose?

      -- No, that's enough! -- said the indignant father. --
      There are limits to all patience.
      If you ask the fifth question at last,
      You will count step by step!

      -- It's all wrong, -- said the Caterpillar.
      -- Yes, that's not quite right, -- agreed Alice timidly. -- Some of the words are wrong.
      -- It's all wrong, from the very beginning to the very end, -- said the Caterpillar sternly.
      There was a silence.
      -- How tall do you want to be? -- asked the Caterpillar at last.
      -- Oh, it doesn't matter, -- said Alice quickly. -- But you know, it's so unpleasant to be changing all the time --
      "I don't know," snapped the Caterpillar.
      Alice was silent; she had never been so much contradicted in her life, and she felt herself getting impatient.
      "Are you satisfied now?" asked the Caterpillar.
      "If you don't mind, madam," answered Alice, "I wish I were a little taller. Three inches is such an awful size!
      " "That's a lovely size!" cried the Caterpillar angrily, and drew herself up to her full length. (She was exactly three inches tall.)
      "But I'm not used to it!" said poor Alice plaintively. And she thought to herself, "How touchy they all are!"
      “You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar, putting the hookah into its mouth and blowing smoke into the air.
      Alice waited patiently until the Caterpillar deigned to pay attention to her again. After about two minutes the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, yawned once, twice, and stretched. Then it slid off the mushroom and disappeared into the grass, throwing at Alice as a farewell:
      “Bite off one side and you’ll grow; take the other and you’ll shrink!
      ” “One side of what?” thought Alice. “The other side of what?
      ” “The mushroom,” answered the Caterpillar, as if it had heard the question, and disappeared from sight.
      Alice looked thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to determine which side was one and which was the other; the mushroom was round, and this completely confused her. At last she made up her mind: she took the mushroom in her hands and broke off a piece from each side.
      “I wonder which one is which?” she thought, and bit off a little of the one she held in her right hand. At the same moment she felt a violent blow from below on her chin: it hit her legs!
      This sudden change frightened her greatly; there was not a moment to lose, for she was rapidly growing smaller. Alice took up another piece, but her chin was pressed so firmly against her legs that she could not open her mouth. At last she succeeded – and bit off a little of the mushroom from her left hand.

      * * * * *

      “Well, my head is free at last!” Alice exclaimed joyfully. However, her joy immediately changed to alarm: her shoulders had disappeared. She looked down, but saw only a neck of incredible length, which towered like a huge pole above the green sea of ​​foliage.
      “What is this greenery?” said Alice. “And where have my shoulders gone? My poor little hands, where are you? Why can’t I see you?”
      As she spoke she moved her arms, but still could not see them; there was only a rustling sound among the leaves far below.
      Finding that she could not raise her arms to her head, she bent her head down towards them, and was delighted to find that her neck, like a snake, could bend in any direction. Alice arched her neck in a graceful zigzag, preparing to dive into the foliage (she had already realized that these were the tops of the trees under which she had just been standing), when suddenly she heard a loud hissing. She started and stepped back. A turtledove rushed straight into her face, beating its wings furiously.
      “Snake!” cried the Turtledove.
      “I’m not a snake!” cried Alice indignantly. “Leave me alone!
      ” “I say it’s a snake!” repeated the Turtledove, a little more restrained.
      And with a sob she added:
      “I’ve tried everything, and it’s all in vain.” They are not happy with anything!
      "I don't know what you're talking about!" said Alice.
      "Tree roots, river banks, bushes," continued the Turtledove, not listening. "Oh, those snakes! You can't please them!"
      Alice became more and more perplexed. However, she knew that there was no point in asking the Turtledove any questions until she had finished.
      "It's not enough that I hatch the chicks, but I have to watch them day and night for snakes! I haven't slept a wink for three weeks!
      " "I'm so sorry you're disturbed like this," said Alice.
      She began to understand what the matter was.
      "And just when I got myself settled in the highest tree," continued the Turtledove, louder and louder, and at last breaking into a scream, "just when I thought I'd got rid of them at last, there they are! Climbing right out of the sky at me! Ooh! The snake in the grass!"
      "I'm not a snake!" said Alice. "I'm only - I'm only -
      " "Now, tell me, tell me, who are you?" said the Turtledove. "It's obvious you're trying to make something up.
      " "I - I - am a little girl," said Alice, rather doubtfully, remembering how many times she had changed that day.
      "Oh, indeed," answered the Turtledove, with the greatest contempt. "I've seen many little girls in my time, but never one with a neck like that! No, you can't deceive me! You're a regular snake, that's what you are! You'll tell me next you've never tasted an egg.
      " "No, of course I have," answered Alice. (She always told the truth.) "Little girls eat eggs, you know.
      " "Impossible," said the Turtledove. "But if they do, they're snakes too!" I have nothing more to say.
      This thought so startled Alice that she was silent. And the Turtledove added:
      “I know, I know, you’re looking for eggs! And whether you’re a girl or a snake,
      it’s all the same to me.” “But it’s not at all a matter of indifference to me,” Alice hastened to object. “And, to tell the truth, I’m not looking for eggs! And even if I were, I shouldn’t need yours. I don’t like raw eggs!
      ” “Well, then, get out!” said the Turtledove sullenly, and sat down on her nest again.
      Alice began to descend to the ground, which was not at all easy: her neck kept getting entangled in the branches, so that she had to stop and pull it out. After a while, Alice remembered that she was still holding pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she began carefully, biting off first one and then another, sometimes growing and sometimes shrinking, until at last she resumed her former shape.
      At first this seemed very strange to her, since she had already become unaccustomed to her own height, but soon she got used to it and began talking to herself again.
      -- Well, there, half of what I planned is done! How wonderful all these changes are! You never know what will happen to you next... Well, I'm my old size again now. And now I must get into that garden. I wish I knew how to do it!
      Here she came out into a clearing, where there was a small house, not more than four feet high.
      -- Whoever lives there, -- thought Alice, -- I can't go there like this. I'll frighten them to death!
      She began to pick at the mushroom and did not go near the house until she had shrunk to nine inches.
Chapter VI. Pig and Pepper


      She stood for a minute looking thoughtfully at the house. Suddenly a footman in livery ran out of the forest and knocked at the door. (She decided that he was a footman by his livery; judging by his appearance, he was simply a bream.) Another liveried footman with a round face and bulging eyes, very similar to a frog, opened the door. Alice noticed that they both had powdered wigs with long curls on their heads. She wanted to know what was going on here, so she hid behind a tree and began to listen.
      The Footman-Bream took a huge letter from under his arm (as big as himself, no less) and handed it to the Frog.
      “To the Duchess,” he said with extraordinary importance. “From the Queen. An invitation to croquet.”
      The Frog took the letter and repeated the words just as importantly, only slightly changing their order:
      “From the Queen.” To the Duchess. An invitation to croquet.
      Then they bowed so low to each other that their curls got tangled.
      Alice was so overcome with laughter that she had to run away into the woods to avoid being heard; when she came back and looked out from behind the tree, the Fish-Footman had gone, and the Frog was sitting on the ground by the door, staring vacantly at the sky.
      Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked.
      “There’s no need to knock,” said the Footman. “For two reasons. Firstly, I’m on the same side as you. And secondly, they’re making such a noise in there that no one will hear you anyway.
      ” And indeed, there was a dreadful noise in the house – somebody was screaming, somebody was sneezing, and now and then there was a deafening crash, as if someone was breaking dishes.
      “Tell me, please,” said Alice, “how can I get into the house?”
      “You might knock,” the Frog went on, without answering the question, “if there was a door between us. For instance, if you were in there, you would knock, and then I would let you out.”
      All this time he had been looking up at the sky. This struck Alice as extremely impolite.
      “Perhaps it’s not his fault,” she thought. “It’s only that his eyes are almost on the tops of his heads. But of course he might answer questions.
      ” “How can I get into the house?” she repeated loudly.
      “I’ll sit here,” said the Frog, “if only until tomorrow—”
      At that moment the door flew open, and a huge dish came flying at the Frog’s head. But the Frog didn’t even blink. The dish flew past him, lightly grazing his nose, and smashed against the tree behind him.
      “—or until the day after tomorrow,” he went on, as if nothing had happened.
      “How can I get into the house?” -- Alice repeated louder.
      -- Is it worth going there? -- said the Frog. -- That is the question.
      Perhaps it was so, but it did not make Alice feel any better.
      "How fond they are of arguing, these little animals!" she thought. "They drive one crazy with their talk!"
      The Frog seemed to think it was high time to repeat his remarks, with slight variations.
      "I shall sit here," he said, "day after day, month after month...
      " "What shall I do?" asked Alice.
      "Anything you like," answered the Frog, and he whistled.
      "It's no use talking to him," thought Alice vexedly. "He's so stupid!"
      She pushed open the door and went in.
      The large kitchen was full of smoke; the Duchess was sitting on a rickety stool in the middle, rocking her baby; the cook was bending over a huge cauldron of soup at the stove.
      "There's too much pepper in this soup!" thought Alice. She began to sneeze and could not stop.
      There was certainly too much pepper in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed now and then, and the baby sneezed and squealed continually. The only people who did not sneeze were the cook, and a huge cat who sat by the stove and grinned from ear to ear.
      "Pray tell me why your cat smiles like that?" Alice asked timidly. She did not know whether it was a good idea to speak first, but she could not help it.
      "Because," said the Duchess. "It's a Cheshire cat—that's why! You little pig!
      " She uttered the last words with such fury that Alice quite jumped. But she saw at once that it referred not to herself, but to the baby, and went on with determination:
      "I didn't know Cheshire cats always smiled. In fact, I didn't know cats could smile at all.
      " "They can," answered the Duchess. "And nearly all of them do.
      "I never saw such a cat," said Alice politely, much pleased to see the conversation going on so well.
      "You haven't seen a great deal," said the Duchess, "that's certain!"
      Alice did not like her tone at all, and thought she had better turn the conversation to something else. While she was wondering what else to talk about, the cook took the kettle off the stove, and without wasting a word began throwing everything she could lay her hands on at the Duchess and the baby: a shovel, a poker, and a pair of coal-tongs flew at their heads; then came cups, plates, and saucers. But the Duchess did not move an inch, though she was hit by some of the things; and the baby had been bawling so loudly before, that it was impossible to tell whether it was in pain or not.
      "Be careful, please!" cried Alice, starting up with alarm.
      -- Oh, right in the nose! Poor little nose!
      (At that moment, a huge plate flew right past the baby and almost bit off his nose).
      "If people didn't meddle in other people's business," muttered the Duchess hoarsely, "the world would go round faster!
      " "No good would come of it," said Alice, glad of the opportunity to show off her knowledge. "Just think what would happen to day and night. The world only goes round in twenty-four hours...
      " "A round?" repeated the Duchess thoughtfully.
      And turning to the cook, she added:
      "Take her round! To begin with, cut off her head!"
      Alice looked anxiously at the cook, but the latter took no notice and went on stirring her soup.
      "Twenty-four, I think," continued Alice thoughtfully, "or perhaps twelve?
      " "Leave me alone," said the Duchess. "I've never been good with numbers!"
      She sang a lullaby and rocked the baby, shaking him violently at the end of each verse.

      Beat your son
      Because he sneezes,
      He's teasing you, I'm sure,
      He's annoying you on purpose!

      Chorus:

      (The baby and the cook caught him)

      Woof! Woof! Woof!

      The Duchess sang the second verse. She tossed the baby up to the ceiling and caught him, and he squealed so loudly that Alice could hardly understand the words.

      Every mother beats her son
      Because he sneezes.
      He might adore pepper,
      But he won't!

      Chorus:

      Woof! Woof! Woof!

      "Here!" cried the Duchess suddenly, and threw the baby to Alice.
      "You can rock him a little, if you like. I must go and change for the Queen's croquet."
      With these words she ran out of the kitchen. The cook threw a saucepan after her, but missed.
      Alice almost dropped the baby from her arms. It looked strange, and its arms and legs stuck out in all directions, like a starfish. The poor thing was puffing like a locomotive, and was twisted so that Alice could hardly hold on to it.
      At last she figured out how to handle it: she took it by the right ear with one hand and by the left leg with the other, twisted it into a knot and held it without letting go for a minute. In this way she managed to carry it out of the house.
      “If I don’t take the baby with me,” thought Alice, “they’ll kill it in a day or two. To leave it here is simply a crime!”
      She said the last words aloud, and the baby grunted softly in agreement (it had stopped sneezing).
      "Don't grunt," said Alice. "Express your thoughts in some other way!"
      The baby grunted again. Alice looked at its face with some anxiety. It seemed to her very suspicious: its nose was so turned up that it looked more like a snout, and its eyes were too small for a baby. Altogether
      , Alice did not like its appearance at all. “Perhaps it has only sniffled,” she thought, and looked into its eyes to see if there were any tears there. There
      were none at all.
      “Now, my dear,” said Alice seriously, “if you are going to turn into a pig, I will have nothing more to do with you. So watch out!”
      The poor thing sniffled (or grunted – it is difficult to say!) again, and they went on their way in silence.
      Alice was just beginning to wonder what to do with it when she got home, when suddenly it grunted again, and so loudly that she was confused. She looked closely at its face and saw clearly: it was a regular pig! It would have been foolish to carry him any further. Alice put him down, and was very glad to see him trot away so cheerfully.
      “If he were only a little bigger,” she thought, “he would have made a very unpleasant child. But as a pig he’s very nice!”
      And she began to think of other children who would have made excellent pigs.
      “If only I knew how to transform them,” she thought, with a shudder.

Fig. 3


      A few steps away from her, the Cheshire Cat was sitting on a branch. When he saw Alice, the Cat only smiled. He looked good-natured, but his claws were long and he had so many teeth that Alice immediately realized that he was not to be trifled with.
      "Kitty! Cheshiy!" Alice began timidly. She did not know whether he would like this name, but he only smiled wider in response.
      "It's all right," thought Alice, "he seems pleased."
      But aloud she asked:
      "Tell me, please, which way should I go from here?
      " "Where do you want to go?" answered the Cat.
      "I don't care...," said Alice.
      "Then it doesn't matter where you go," remarked the Cat.
      "...as long as you get somewhere," explained Alice.
      "You are sure to get somewhere," said the Cat. "You only have to walk long enough."
      It was impossible to disagree with that. Alice decided to change the subject.
      "What kind of people live here?" she asked.
      “Over there,” said the Cat, waving his right paw, “lives the Hatter. And over there,” he waved his left paw, “is the March Hare. It makes no difference which one you go to. They are both mad.
      ” “What good do I want madmen for?” said Alice.
      “It can’t be helped,” said the Cat. “We are all mad here—you and I.
      ” “How do you know I’m mad?” asked Alice.
      “Of course I’m not,” answered the Cat. “Otherwise how could you have come here?”
      Alice did not find this argument at all convincing, but she did not argue, and only asked:
      “How do you know you are mad?
      ” “To begin with, the dog is mad. Do you agree?
      ” “Let’s say so,” agreed Alice.
      “Next,” said the Cat, “the dog growls when he is angry, and wags his tail when he is pleased.” Well, I grumble when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Then I'm mad.
      "I don't think you grumble, I think you purr," said Alice. "At least, that's what I call it."
      "Call it what you like," said the Cat. "It doesn't make any difference." "Are you playing croquet at the Queen's to-day?
      " "I should like to very much," said Alice, "but I haven't been asked yet.
      " "Then till this evening," said the Cat, and disappeared.
      Alice was not much surprised at this; she was beginning to be accustomed to odd things. She was standing and looking at the branch where the Cat had just been sitting, when suddenly it appeared in the same place again.
      "By the way, what has become of the child?" said the Cat. "I quite forgot to ask you.
      " "It's turned into a pig," answered Alice, without blinking an eye.
      "I thought so," said the Cat, and disappeared again.
      Alice waited a little to see if he would appear again, but he did not, so she went to the place where he said the March Hare lived.
      "I've seen hatters before," she said to herself. "The March Hare seems much more interesting to me. Besides, it's May - perhaps he's a little more himself."
      Then she looked up and saw the Cat again.
      "Did you say a pig or a gosling?" asked the Cat.
      "I said a pig," answered Alice. "Can you disappear and reappear less suddenly? It makes my head spin.
      " "Yes," said the Cat, and disappeared - very slowly this time. The tip of his tail was the first to disappear, and the smile last; it hung in the air for a long time after everything else had vanished.
      "Y-yes!" thought Alice. "I've seen cats without smiles, but smiles without a cat!" I've never seen anything like it in my life.
      Walking a little further, she saw the March Hare's house. There was no mistaking it - two chimneys stuck out of the hare's fur roof, remarkably similar to hare's ears. The house was so big that Alice decided to first eat a little mushroom, which she held in her left hand. After waiting until it had grown to two feet, she moved hesitantly towards the house.
      "But what if he's violent after all?" she thought. "I'd rather go to the Hatter!"
Chapter VII. THE MADNESS OF TEA


Fig. 4


      Near the house, under a tree, stood a table laid with tea, and at it the March Hare and the Hatter were drinking tea, with the Dormouse fast asleep between them. The Hatter and the Hare were leaning on her as if she were a pillow, and talking over her head.
      “Poor Dormouse,” thought Alice. “How uncomfortable she must be! However, she’s asleep, so she doesn’t care.”
      The table was large, but the tea-drinkers were sitting at one end, in a corner. When they saw Alice, they cried out:
      “Taken! Taken! No
      room!” “Plenty of room!” Alice said indignantly, and sat down in a large armchair at the head of the table.
      “Drink some wine,” suggested the March Hare cheerfully.
      Alice looked at the table, but saw neither a bottle nor glasses.
      “I don’t see it,” she said.
      “Of course! It’s not here!” answered the March Hare.
      “Then why are you offering it to me?” -- Alice said angrily. -- That's not very polite.
      -- Why did you sit down without being invited? -- answered the March Hare. -- That's also impolite!
      -- I didn't know this table was just for you, -- said Alice. -- There are so many more places here.
      -- You look rather overgrown! -- the Hatter suddenly spoke.
      Until now he had been silent and had only been looking at Alice with curiosity.
      -- It would do no harm to have your hair cut.
      -- Learn not to get personal, -- answered Alice, not without severity. -- It's very rude.
      The Hatter opened his eyes wide, but could not find what to say.
      -- How is a raven like a desk? -- he asked at last.
      -- That's better, -- thought Alice. -- Riddles are so much more fun...
      -- I think I can guess that, -- she said aloud.
      -- Do you mean to say that you think you know the answer to this riddle? -- asked the March Hare.
      "Quite right," said Alice.
      "You might have said so," said the March Hare. "One should always say what one means.
      " "I do," said Alice hastening to explain. "At least—at least I always mean what I say—and that's the same thing—
      " "Not the same thing at all," said the Hatter. "Then you'd better say that 'I see what I eat' and 'I eat what I see' were the same thing!
      " "Then you'd better say," said the Dormouse, without opening her eyes, "that 'I breathe while I sleep' and 'I sleep while I breathe' were the same thing!
      " "At least to you they are the same thing!" said the Hatter, and the conversation was broken off.
      For a minute they sat silent. Alice tried to remember the little she knew about ravens and desks.
      The Hatter spoke first.
      "What's the date?" he asked, turning to Alice and taking his watch out of his pocket. He looked at it anxiously, shook it, and put it to his ear.
      Alice thought for a moment and then said,
      "The third.
      " "It's two days late," sighed the Hatter.
      "I told you you mustn't butter it!" he added angrily, turning to the March Hare.
      "It was fresh butter," said the Hare timidly.
      "Oh, well, there must have been some crumbs in it," grumbled the Hatter. "You shouldn't have buttered it with a bread-knife."
      The March Hare took the watch and looked at it sadly, then dipped it in his cup of tea and looked again.
      "It was fresh butter, I assure you," he repeated. Apparently he could think of nothing else to say.
      Alice peered over his shoulder with curiosity.
      "What a funny watch!" she remarked. "It tells the date, not the hour!
      " "What's the matter?" muttered the Hatter. "Does your watch tell the year?
      " "Of course not," answered Alice readily. "A year is a very long time!
      " "Well, it's the same with me!" said the Hatter.
      Alice was at a loss. The Hatter's words seemed to make no sense, though each word was clear.
      "I don't quite follow you," she said politely.
      "The Dormouse is asleep again," remarked the Hatter, splashing hot tea on her nose.
      The Dormouse shook her head in annoyance, and without opening her eyes, said:
      "Of course, of course, I was just going to say the same thing.
      " "Have you guessed the riddle?" asked the Hatter, turning to Alice again.
      "No," answered Alice. "I give up. What's the answer?"
      "I haven't the slightest idea," said the Hatter.
      "Neither have I," said the March Hare.
      Alice sighed.
      "If you had nothing better to do," she said angrily, "you'd think of something better than riddles without answers. As it is, you're only wasting your time!
      " "If you knew Time as well as I do," said the Hatter, "you wouldn't say that. You can't lose it! You've picked the wrong man!
      " "I don't understand," said Alice.
      "Of course I do!" the Hatter shook his head scornfully. "I suppose you've never spoken to him!
      " "Perhaps I haven't," answered Alice cautiously. "But I've often thought of ways to kill time!"
      -- Ah! then it all becomes clear, -- said the Hatter. -- Killing Time! How could he like that? If you hadn't quarrelled with him, you could ask him for anything you liked. Suppose it's nine o'clock in the morning -- time to go to school. And you whisper a word to him, and -- bam! -- the hand of the clock runs forward! Half-past one -- lunch!
      (-- That would be nice! -- sighed the March Hare softly.)
      -- Of course, that would be very nice, -- said Alice thoughtfully, -- but I shouldn't have time to get hungry.
      -- At first, perhaps, -- answered the Hatter. -- But you can keep the hands at half-past one as long as you like.
      -- You did, didn't you? -- asked Alice.
      The Hatter shook his head gloomily.
      -- No, -- he answered. -- We quarrelled in March -- just before this one (he pointed with his spoon at the March Hare) went mad. The Queen was giving a big concert, and I had to sing ``The Owl''. Do you know that song?

      You're winking, my owl!
      I don't know what's the matter with you. `

      `I heard something like that,'' said Alice.
      ``And then this is how it is,'' continued the Hatter. ``

      How high you are above us,
      Like a tray under the sky!

      '' Then the Dormouse started and began singing in her sleep: ``You wink, you wink, you wink...''
      She couldn't stop. The Hare and the Hatter had
      to pinch her on either side to make her stop. ``As soon as I finished the first verse, someone said: ``Of course, it would be better if he kept quiet, but one must kill time somehow!'' The Queen cried out: ``Kill Time! He means to kill Time! Cut off his head!'' `
      `How cruel!'' cried Alice.
      -- Since then, -- the Hatter continued sadly, -- Time doesn't lift a finger for me! And the clock always shows six o'clock...
      Then it occurred to Alice.
      -- Is that why tea is laid here? -- she asked.
      -- Yes, -- answered the Hatter with a sigh. -- It's always tea time here. We don't even have time to wash the dishes!
      -- And you just change seats, do you? -- guessed Alice.
      -- Quite right, -- said the Hatter. -- Let's drink our cup and then move on to the next.
      -- And when you get to the end, then what? -- Alice ventured to ask.
      -- What if we change the subject? -- asked the March Hare, yawning widely. -- I'm tired of this talk. I propose that the young lady tell us a story.
      -- I'm afraid I don't know anything about it, -- Alice was frightened.
      -- Then let the Dormouse tell the story, -- cried the Hatter and the Hare. - Sonya, wake up!
      Sopya slowly opened her eyes.
      “I wasn’t going to sleep,” she whispered hoarsely. “I heard everything you said.
      ” “Tell me the story!” demanded the March Hare.
      “Yes, please tell me,” Alice said.
      “And do hurry up,” added the Hatter. “Or you’ll fall asleep again!
      ” “Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began quickly. “Their names were Helen, Lacy, and Tillie, and they lived at the bottom of a well—
      ” “What did they eat?” Alice asked. She was always interested in what people ate and drank.
      “Kissel,” answered the Dormouse, after a moment’s thought.
      “Always jelly? That’s impossible,” Alice objected softly. “They would have been ill then.
      ” “And they were ill,” said the Dormouse. “Very seriously.”
      Alice tried to understand how it was possible to eat nothing but jelly all her life, but it was so strange and surprising that she only asked:
      “Why did they live at the bottom of the well?
      ” “Have some more tea,” said the March Hare, leaning towards Alice.
      “More?” Alice asked resentfully. “I haven’t drunk anything yet.
      ” “She won’t have any more tea,” said the March Hare into space.
      “You probably mean she won’t have less tea: it’s much easier to drink more than less than nothing,” said the Hatter.
      “Nobody asked your opinion,” said Alice.
      “Now who’s getting personal?” asked the Hatter triumphantly.
      Alice did not know what to say to that. She poured herself some tea and buttered her bread, and then turned to the Dormouse and repeated her question:
      “Then why did they live at the bottom of the well?”
      The Dormouse thought again and at last said:
      “Because there was jelly in the well.”
      "There are no such wells," cried Alice indignantly.
      But the Hatter and the March Hare shushed her, and the Dormouse muttered sullenly:
      "If you can't behave yourself, finish the story yourself!
      " "Excuse me," said Alice meekly. "Please go on, I won't interrupt anymore. Perhaps there is one such well somewhere.
      " "You said ``one'' too!" snorted the Dormouse.
      However, she agreed to continue the story.
      "And I must tell you that these three sisters lived happily...
      " "Happily?" asked Alice. "And what were they singing?
      " "Not singing, but drinking," answered the Dormouse. "Purple jelly, of course.
      " "I want a clean cup," interrupted the Hatter. "Let's move over."
      And he moved to the next chair. The Dormouse took his place. The March Hare took the Dormouse's place, and Alice, with a heavy heart, took the Hare's place. The Hatter was the only winner; Alice, on the other hand, had lost heavily, for the March Hare had just tipped the milk jug into his plate.
      Alice did not want to offend the Dormouse again, and she asked cautiously:
      "I don't understand... How did they live there?
      " "What's there to understand?" said the Hatter. "Fish live in water. And those little sisters lived in jelly! Do you understand, silly?
      " "But why?" Alice asked the Dormouse, pretending not to have heard the Hatter's last remark.
      "Because they were jelly young ladies."
      This answer so embarrassed poor Alice that she fell silent.
      -- So they lived, -- continued the Dormouse sleepily, yawning and rubbing her eyes, -- like fishes in jelly. And they drew, too, all sorts of things, anything that begins with M.
      -- Why with M? -- asked Alice.
      -- Why not? -- asked the March Hare.
      Alice said nothing.
      -- I should like to draw, too, -- she said at last. -- By the well.
      -- Draw and prick myself? -- asked the Hare.
      Meanwhile the Dormouse had closed her eyes and was dozing. But then the Hatter pinched her, and she squealed and woke up.
      -- ... begins with M, -- she went on. -- They drew mousetraps, and the moon, and mathematics, and sets... Have you ever seen sets drawn?
      -- Sets of what? -- asked Alice.
      -- Nothing, -- answered the Dormouse. -- Just sets!
      “I don’t know,” Alice began, “maybe...
      ” “If you don’t know, be quiet,” the Hatter interrupted her.
      Alice could not bear such rudeness: she got up without saying a word and walked away. The Dormouse fell asleep at once, and the Hare and the Hatter did not pay any attention to Alice’s departure, although she turned around twice, hoping that they would come to their senses and call her back.
      Looking back for the last time, she saw that they were putting the Dormouse into the teapot.
      “I’ll never go there again!” Alice repeated to herself, making her way through the forest. “I’ve never seen such a silly tea party in my life!”
      Then she noticed a door in a tree.
      “How strange!” thought Alice. “Well, everything is strange today. I’ll go in through that door.”
      And so she did.
      And again she found herself in the long hall near the glass table.
      “Well, now I’ll be smarter,” she said to herself, took the key and first of all unlocked the door leading to the garden. Then she took out the pieces of mushroom that were in her pocket and ate until she became a foot tall. Then she made her way along a narrow corridor and finally found herself in a wonderful garden among bright flowers and cool fountains.
Chapter VIII. ROYAL CROQUET


      At the entrance to the garden there was a large rose-bush. The roses on it were white, but three gardeners were standing near it, busily painting them red. Alice was surprised and went closer to see what was going on. As she approached, she heard one of the gardeners say to another:
      “Be careful, Five! You’ve splashed me again!
      ” “It wasn’t my fault,” answered Five sullenly. “It was Seven who nudged me in the elbow!”
      Seven looked at him and said:
      “That’s right, Five! Always blame someone else!
      ” “You’d better keep quiet,” said Five. “Yesterday I heard the Queen say with my own ears that it was high time you had your head cut off!
      ” “For what?” asked the first gardener.
      “It’s none of your business, Two!” snapped Seven.
      “No, it does,” objected Five. “And I’ll tell him why.” For bringing the cook tulip bulbs instead of onions!
      Seven threw down his brush.
      “Well, you know, it’s such an injustice…” he began, but then his eye fell on Alice, and he stopped. The other two looked around, and all three bowed low.
      “Pray tell me,” Alice asked timidly, “why are you painting these roses?”
      Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two, who looked around and said quietly:
      “You see, young lady, we should have planted red roses, but we, fools, planted white ones. If the Queen finds out, we’ll be beheaded, you know. So, young lady, you see, we’re trying hard here until she comes…”
      At that moment Five (he had been gazing into the garden all this time) cried:
      “The Queen!”
      The gardeners fell on their faces. They heard footsteps. Alice turned around, impatient to see the Queen.
      Ten soldiers marched in front, holding pikes; they looked very much like the gardeners, flat and square, with their arms and legs at the corners. Behind them walked ten courtiers; their clothes were embroidered with crosses, and they walked in twos, like soldiers. Behind the courtiers ran the royal children, whose clothes were adorned with hearts embroidered in red gold; there were ten of them, too; the sweet little ones held hands and skipped merrily as they walked. Behind them walked the guests, mostly Kings and Queens. The White Rabbit was there too; he was talking quickly and nervously and smiling at everyone. He passed Alice without noticing her. Behind the guests walked the Knave of Hearts, carrying a crown on a scarlet cushion. And bringing up the rear of this magnificent procession were the KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
      Alice hesitated: perhaps she, too, should fall on her face at the sight of such a magnificent procession? However, she did not remember any rules on this matter.
      “And anyway, what’s the point of having a procession if everyone’s going to fall on their faces? No one will see anything then...”
      And she remained standing.
      When the procession reached Alice, everyone stopped and stared at her, and the Queen asked sternly:
      “Who’s that?”
      She addressed the Knave, but he only smiled and bowed in response.
      “Fool!” said the Queen, shaking her head irritably.
      Then she turned to Alice and asked:
      “What’s your name, child?
      ” “My name is Alice, with your Majesty’s permission,” Alice answered politely.
      To herself she added:
      “But it’s only a pack of cards! What have I to be afraid of them?
      ” “And who are these?” asked the Queen, pointing to the gardeners collapsed around the bush. They lay face downwards, and as the backs of all the cards in the pack were all the same, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or courtiers, or perhaps her own children.
      “How should I know?” answered Alice, surprised at her own boldness. “It’s none of my business.”
      The Queen turned purple with rage, and, her eyes glaring at her like a wild animal, she screamed at the top of her voice.
      “Off with her head! Off with—
      ” “Nonsense!” said Alice very loudly and decisively.
      The Queen was silent.
      And the King put his hand on her shoulder and said timidly:
      “Come to your senses, my dear! She’s only a child!”
      The Queen turned away angrily and ordered the Knave:
      “Turn them over! ”
      The Knave carefully turned the gardeners over with the toe of his boot.
      “Get up!” cried the Queen in a loud, shrill voice.
      The gardeners jumped up and began bowing to the Queen, the King, the royal children, and everyone else.
      “Stop that this minute!” screamed the Queen. “Your bowing makes me dizzy!”
      And looking at the rosebush, she added:
      “And what were you doing here?
      ” “With your Majesty’s permission,” began Two humbly, dropping on one knee, “we wanted—
      ” “All clear!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been carefully examining the roses. “Off with their heads!”
      And the procession moved on. Only three soldiers remained behind to carry out the sentence. The unfortunate gardeners ran to Alice for help.
      “Don’t be afraid,” said Alice. “I won’t let anyone hurt you.”
      And she put them into a flower-pot that stood nearby. The soldiers walked around, looked for them, and walked away.
      “Well, have you cut off their heads?” cried the Queen.
      "Their heads are missing, Your Majesty!" shouted the soldiers.
      "Excellent!" screamed the Queen. "Shall we play croquet? "
      The soldiers looked at Alice in silence; the Queen was evidently speaking to her.
      "Let's play!" cried Alice.
      "Come on!" roared the Queen.
      And Alice walked into the crowd of guests, wondering in bewilderment what would happen next.
      "What... what lovely weather is this, isn't it?" said someone timidly. She looked up and saw the White Rabbit walking beside her, looking at her uneasily.
      "Yes, it is lovely weather," agreed Alice. "And where is the Duchess?
      " "Sh-sh-sh," hissed the Rabbit, looking anxiously around. He stood on tiptoe and whispered in her ear:
      "She's been sentenced to death.
      " "For what?" asked Alice.
      “Did you say, ‘What a pity?’” asked the Rabbit.
      “I never meant to,” answered Alice. “I’m not at all sorry for her! I said, ‘What for?’”
      “She boxed the Queen’s ears,” said the Rabbit.
      Alice gave a gleeful snort.
      “Hush!” said the Rabbit in alarm. “Suppose the Queen heard! You see, the Duchess was late, and the Queen said—
      ” “Everyone to your places!” cried the Queen in a thunderous voice.
      And off they all ran, bumping into each other, falling and jumping up. However, in a minute everyone was back in their places. The game began.
      Alice thought she had never seen such a strange croquet ground in her life: it was all ruts and furrows. The balls were hedgehogs, the mallets were flamingos, and the wickets were soldiers.
      They made a bridge and stood there while the game was going on.

Fig. 5


      At first Alice could hardly manage her flamingo: she had hardly got him under her arm, head downwards, and drawn his legs back, and was about to strike the hedgehog with him, when he arched his neck and looked her straight in the face, with such astonishment that she began to laugh; and when she had succeeded in getting him down again, lo! the hedgehog was gone, but had turned round and was trotting quietly away. Besides, all the hedgehogs fell into the potholes, and the soldiers-gates straightened up and went to the other end of the ground. In a word, Alice soon decided that it was a very difficult game.
      The players struck all at once, without waiting their turns, and were continually quarrelling and fighting about the hedgehogs; and soon the Queen was in a fury, stamping her feet, and shouting every now and then,
      "Off with her head! Off with his head!
      " Alice began to be uneasy; True, she had not yet had any argument with the Queen about anything, but one might arise at any moment.
      “What will become of me then?” thought Alice. “They are so fond of chopping off heads here. It’s strange that anyone has survived at all!”
      She looked around and began to think how she could slip away unnoticed, when suddenly something incomprehensible appeared above her head. At first Alice could not make out what it was, but after a minute she realized that it was a lonely smile hovering in the air.
      “It’s the Cheshire Cat,” she said to herself. “That’s good! At least there will be someone to talk to!
      ” “Well, how are you?” asked the Cat, as soon as his mouth appeared in the air.
      Alice waited until the eyes appeared, and then nodded.
      “It’s no use answering now,” she thought. “I’ll wait until the ears appear - or at least one!”
      In a minute the whole head appeared; Alice put the flamingo down and began her story, glad to have someone to talk to. The Cat evidently decided that the head was quite enough, and did not argue further.
      “I don’t think they play at all right,” said Alice. “There’s no justice, and everyone’s shouting so loudly that you can’t hear your own voice. There are no rules, or if there are, no one keeps them. You can’t imagine how difficult it is to play when everything is alive. For example, the gate I have to go through now has gone for a walk to the other side of the playground! I’d drive away the Queen’s hedgehog at once, but he ran away as soon as he saw mine!
      ” “And how do you like the Queen?” asked the Cat quietly.
      “I don’t like her at all,” answered Alice. “She’s so—”
      At that moment she noticed that the Queen was standing behind her and eavesdropping.
      “—plays so well,” said Alice quickly, “that I feel like giving up at once.”
      The Queen smiled and walked away.
      “Who are you talking to?” asked the King, coming up to Alice and looking curiously at the floating head.
      “This is my friend, the Cheshire Cat,” answered Alice. “Allow me to introduce...
      ” “I don’t like him at all,” remarked the King. “However, he can kiss my hand if he wants to.
      ” “I have no particular desire,” said the Cat.
      “Don’t you dare be impertinent,” muttered the King. “And don’t look at me like that. ”
      And he hid behind Alice’s back.
      “Cats are not forbidden to look at kings,” said Alice. “I read that somewhere, I just don’t remember where.
      ” “No, he must be removed,” said the King decisively.
      Seeing the Queen passing by, he shouted:
      “Darling, have that cat removed!”
      The Queen had only one answer to everything.
      “Off with his head!” she shouted without looking.
      "I'll fetch the executioner myself!" said the King joyfully, and ran off.
      Alice heard the Queen shouting something loudly in the distance, and went to see what was going on. She had already heard the Queen order the heads of three players to be cut off for missing their turn. On the whole, Alice did not like the situation at all: there was such confusion around that she could not understand who was playing. So she wandered back, looking through the ruts for her hedgehog.
      She saw him at once - he was fighting with another hedgehog. She would have liked to hit them, but Alice's flamingo wandered to the other end of the garden; Alice saw how he was trying unsuccessfully to fly up a tree.
      When Alice finally caught him and brought him back, the hedgehogs had already stopped fighting and scattered.
      "Well, so be it," thought Alice. "The gate is gone, too, anyway."
      She tucked the flamingo under her arm to keep it from running away again, and returned to the Cat; she wanted to talk to it some more.
      When she reached the place where its head was floating in the air, she was surprised to see a large crowd around it. The Executioner, the King, and the Queen were arguing loudly; each shouting his own words without listening to the others, and the others were silent and only shifted awkwardly from foot to foot.
      Seeing Alice, all three rushed towards her to ask her to settle their dispute. They loudly repeated their arguments, but since they were all talking at once, she could not understand what the matter was.
      The Executioner said that you can’t cut off a head if there is nothing else but the head; he had never done such a thing and did not intend to; he was too old for that, that’s what!
      The King said that since there is a head, it can be cut off. And there’s no need for such nonsense!
      And the Queen said that if they didn't stop chattering and get to work this very minute, she would have every head cut off!
      (It was these words that plunged the company into dismay.)
      Alice could think of nothing better to say than:
      "The cat belongs to the Duchess. It would be better to consult her.
      " "She's in prison," said the Queen, turning to the executioner. "Bring her here!"
      The executioner ran off as fast as he could to carry out the order.
      As soon as he had run away, the Cat's head began to melt away, so that by the time the executioner brought the Duchess, the head was no longer visible. The King and the executioner rushed about the croquet court, and the guests returned to their game.
Chapter IX. The Tale of the Mock Turtle


      “Oh, my dear, you can’t imagine how glad I am to see you,” said the Duchess tenderly, taking Alice’s arm and leading her aside.
      Alice was pleasantly surprised to see the Duchess in such a good mood, and thought that it must be the pepper that made her so hot-tempered.
      “When I am a Duchess,” she said to herself (without much hope, though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup is nice without it! It’s pepper, I suppose, that makes people disagree with everyone...”
      Alice was very glad to have discovered a new rule.
      “Vinegar makes people sullen,” she continued thoughtfully, “mustard makes them upset, onions make them dissemble, wine makes them feel guilty, but buns make them kinder. What a pity no one knows about it. It would be so simple. If only we could eat buns, we would become kinder!”
      She had quite forgotten about the Duchess, and started when the latter said in her ear:
      “You’re thinking of something, my dear, and you don’t say a word. And the moral of it is—No, I can’t think of it! Never mind, I’ll remember later—
      ” “But perhaps there isn’t any moral at all,” said Alice.
      “Oh, no!” said the Duchess. “There’s a moral in everything, if you only know how to find it!”
      And with these words she pressed herself against Alice.
      Alice didn’t like this at all: in the first place, the Duchess was so ugly, and, secondly, her chin was just on a level with Alice’s shoulder, and it was a very sharp chin. But there was nothing to be done—Alice couldn’t ask the Duchess to move away!
      “The game seems to be getting better,” she remarked, somehow to keep up the conversation.
      "I quite agree with you," said the Duchess. "And the moral of it is, ``Love, love, you make the world go round...'' "
      I thought someone said the great thing was to mind your own business," whispered Alice.
      "Well, it's all the same," said the Duchess, digging her chin into Alice's shoulder. "And the moral of it is, think of the meaning, and the words will come!
      " "How she likes to find a moral in everything," thought Alice.
      "You're wondering, of course," said the Duchess, "why I don't put my arm round your waist. To tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure of your flamingo. Or shall I take the risk?
      " "He might bite," said the sensible Alice, who did not at all want the Duchess to put her arm round her.
      "Exactly right," agreed the Duchess. "Flamingos bite just as badly as mustard. And the moral of it is: they are birds of a feather!
      " "Only mustard is not a bird at all," said Alice.
      "You are, as always, quite right," said the Duchess. "How clear-headed!"
      "I believe mustard is a mineral," Alice went on thoughtfully.
      "Of course it is," said the Duchess. She was ready to agree with everything Alice said. "A mineral of enormous explosive power. They make mines of it and lay them in tunnels... And the moral of it is: a good mine in a bad game is the most important thing!
      " "I remember," said Alice suddenly, having ignored the Duchess's last words. "Mustard is a vegetable. True, it doesn't look like a vegetable - but still, it is a vegetable!
      " "I quite agree with you," said the Duchess. "And the moral of it is: every vegetable in its time. Or, if you like, I will formulate it more simply: never think that you are different from what you could be otherwise, than by being different in cases where you cannot help being different.
      `I think I should understand it better,' said Alice politely, `if I could write it down. As it is, I can't quite make it out.
      ' `That's all nonsense compared with what I could say if I chose,' said the Duchess, flattered.
      `Please don't trouble yourself,' said Alice.
      `Oh, come, it's not trouble,' said the Duchess. `I'll give you all I've said yet.
      ' `A trifling present,' thought Alice to herself. `It's a good thing people don't give things like that on birthdays!'
      However, she did not dare say so aloud.
      `Are you thinking of something again?' asked the Duchess, and she buried her chin in Alice's shoulder again.
      `Why shouldn't I?' answered Alice. She felt rather ill at ease.
      `Why shouldn't a pig fly?' said the Duchess. -- And the moral...
      Here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess stopped and trembled. Alice looked up and saw the Queen standing before them, her arms folded across her chest and a menacing frown on her face.
      -- Fine weather, Your Majesty, -- whispered the Duchess faintly.
      -- I give you fair warning, -- cried the Queen, stamping her foot. -- We shall either lose your company, or you shall lose your head. Make up your mind at once -- no, twice as fast!
      The Duchess made up her mind and disappeared at once.
      -- Let us return to our game, -- said the Queen to Alice.
      Alice was so frightened that, without saying a word, she trudged after her to the platform. Meanwhile, the guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence to rest in the shade; however, when they saw the Queen returning, they hurried to their places. And the Queen, coming up, simply announced that a minute's delay would cost them all their lives.
      While the game was going on, the Queen was constantly quarrelling with the players and shouting:
      "Off with his head! Off with her head!"
      The soldiers rose from the ground and took the unfortunate men into custody. As a result, the number of Vorotsy became fewer and fewer. Less than half an hour later, there were none left, and all the players awaited their execution with trepidation.

Fig. 6


      At last the Queen gave up the game, and, catching her breath, asked Alice:
      -- Have you seen the Mock Turtle?
      -- No, -- said Alice, -- I don't even know what he is.
      -- Of course not, -- said the Queen, -- It's what they make Mock Turtle soup out of.
      -- I never saw or heard of one, -- said Alice.
      -- Then come on, -- said the Queen. -- He will tell you all himself.
      And off they went. As Alice went away, she heard the King say in a low voice, turning to the guests:
      -- We forgive you all!
      -- That's good! -- Alice was very glad. -- (She was very sad, thinking about the executions that were to be done.)
      Soon they saw the Gryphon fast asleep in the sun. (If you don't know what the Gryphon looks like, look at the picture.)
      -- Get up, you slacker, -- said the Queen, -- take this young lady to the Mock Turtle. Let him tell her his story. I must go back: I have ordered someone to be executed, and I must see that everything is done properly.
      And she went away, leaving Alice with the Gryphon. Alice did not particularly trust him, but, thinking that she would probably feel safer with him than with the Queen, she stayed.
      “It’s nothing but funny!” he muttered, half to himself, or perhaps turning to Alice.
      “It’s funny?” asked Alice, bewildered.
      “Oh, yes,” answered the Gryphon. “It’s all a lie. Execute! He’ll say that! They’ve never had anything like that before. Well, let’s go!
      ” “Everyone here says nothing but ‘let’s go!’” thought Alice, meekly trudging after the Gryphon. “I’ve never been pushed around so much in my life!”
      After they had gone only a little way, they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance; He lay on a rocky ledge, sighing with such melancholy as if his heart would break. Alice felt very sorry for him.
      “Why is he so sad?” she asked the Gryphon.
      And he answered her almost in the same words:
      “It’s all a lie. Sad! You’d think so! He has nothing to be sad about. Well, let’s go!”
      And they went up to the Mock Turtle. He looked at them with large, tear-filled eyes, but said nothing.
      “This young lady,” began the Gryphon, “wants to hear your story. Give her the story! That’s it!
      ” “Well, I’ll tell you,” said the Mock Turtle in a hollow voice. “Sit down and don’t open your mouth until I’ve finished.”
      The Gryphon and Alice sat down. There was a silence.
      “I don’t know how he’s going to finish when he can’t begin,” thought Alice to herself.
      But there was nothing to do; she waited patiently.
      “Once upon a time,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real Turtle.”
      And there was silence again. Only the Gryphon cleared its throat occasionally, and the Mock Turtle sobbed incessantly. Alice was on the point of getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for a most entertaining story,' but then she decided to wait a little longer.
      At last the Mock Turtle calmed down a little and, sighing heavily, began to speak.
      `When we were little, we went to school at the bottom of the sea. Our teacher was an old Turtle. We called him Octopus.
      ' `Why did you call him Octopus,' asked Alice, `if he really was a Turtle?'
      `We called him Octopus because he always carried a twig,' answered the Mock Turtle angrily. `You're not very quick-witted!
      ' `You should be ashamed to ask such simple questions,' said the Gryphon.
      They both fell silent and stared at poor Alice. She felt as if the ground would swallow her up. At last the Gryphon turned to the Mock Turtle and said,
      "Come on, old man, do hurry up! We can't sit here all day..."
      And the Mock Turtle went on,
      "Yes, we did go to school, and our school was at the bottom of the sea, though you won't believe it...
      " "Why not?" said Alice. "I didn't say a word.
      " "Yes, I did," insisted the Mock Turtle.
      "Don't argue!" snapped the Gryphon.
      But Alice was not going to argue.
      "We had the best education," continued the Mock Turtle. "And no wonder, for we went to school every day...
      " "I went to school every day, too," said Alice. "There's nothing special about it.
      " "Did they teach you anything extra?" asked the Mock Turtle anxiously.
      "Yes," answered Alice. "Music and French.
      " "And washing?" said the Mock Turtle quickly.
      "No, of course not," said Alice indignantly.
      "Well, then your school was not very good," said the Mock Turtle with relief. "And at our school they always added to your bill: "French, music, and washing extra."
      "What do you need washing for?" asked Alice. "After all, you lived at the bottom of the sea.
      " "I couldn't do washing anyway," sighed the Mock Turtle. "I couldn't afford it. I only studied the compulsory subjects.
      " "Which ones?" asked Alice.
      "First we Sneezed and Squeaked, as usual," answered the Mock Turtle. "And then we took up the four operations of Arithmetic: Sliding, Lamenting, Affection, and Exhaustion.
      " "I never heard of Lamenting," Alice ventured to remark.
      "I never heard of Lamentation!" cried the Gryphon, throwing up his paws. "What is 'reading,' I hope you know?
      " "Yes," answered Alice uncertainly, "looking at what is written in a book and... reading.
      " "Oh, yes," said the Gryphon, "and if you don't know what 'lamentation' is, you are a very silly girl."
      Alice lost all desire to find out what 'Lamentation' was, and turned to the Mock Turtle and asked:
      "What else did you learn?
      " "We had Reefs, too, of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, and Dirty Writing, and Coltsfoot. And Mimicry; our mimic was an old eel, and he came once a week. He taught us Triconometry, Physiognomy...
      " "Physiognomy?" asked Alice.
      “I can’t show you that,” answered the Mock Turtle. “I’m too old for that.” And the Gryphon didn’t study it.
      “I had no time,” confirmed the Gryphon. “But I got a classical education.
      ” “How so?” asked Alice.
      “Yes, indeed,” answered the Gryphon. “My teacher, the old crab, and I used to go out into the street and play hopscotch all day long.” What a teacher he was!
      ” “A real classic!” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “But I didn’t get to see him... They say he taught Brass, Drama, and Mexico...
      ” “That’s certainly true,” agreed the Gryphon.
      And they both hung their heads and sighed.
      “And how long did your lessons last?” asked Alice, hastening to change the subject.
      “That depended on us,” answered the Mock Turtle. “When we’ve got everything covered, that’s the end of it.”
      “Will you?” said Alice in surprise.
      “Why are they called lessons?” explained the Gryphon. “Because during lessons we keep our teacher busy... And when we’ve kept him busy and left him with nothing, that’s the end of it. In such cases they say: ‘He’s got plenty of brains.’ Understand?”
      This was so new to Alice that she couldn’t help but think.
      “Then what’s the matter with the teacher?” she asked a little later.
      “Perhaps that’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon intervened decisively. “Tell her about our games...”
Chapter X. SEA QUADRILLE


Fig. 7


      The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and wiped his eyes. He looked at Alice as if he wanted to say something, but was sobbing too much to speak.
      "Well, it's just as if a bone were stuck in his throat," said the Gryphon, after a while. And he began shaking the Mock Turtle and hitting him on the back. At last the Mock Turtle found his voice and, with tears streaming down his face, he said:
      "I suppose you haven't lived long at the bottom of the sea—"
      "I haven't," said Alice.
      "And you probably never saw a live lobster—"
      "But I've tried one—" Alice began, but caught herself and shook her head. "No, I haven't.
      " "Then you haven't any idea how to dance the lobster quadrille.
      " "No, I haven't," sighed Alice. "What kind of dance is it?"
      "First of all," began the Gryphon, "they all line up in a row on the seashore—"
      "In two rows!" -- cried the Mock Turtle. -- Seals, salmon, sea turtles and all the rest. And as soon as you clear the beach of jellyfish...
      -- And it's not so simple, -- put in the Gryphon.
      -- First you take two steps forward... -- continued the Mock Turtle.
      -- Taking a lobster by the handle! -- cried the Gryphon.
      -- Of course, -- confirmed the Mock Turtle, -- You take two passes forward, rush at your partners...
      -- Change lobsters -- and return back in the same order, -- finished the Gryphon.
      -- And then, -- continued the Mock Turtle, -- you throw...
      -- Lobsters! -- cried the Gryphon, jumping into the air.
      -- Further out to sea...
      -- Swim after them! -- cried the Gryphon joyfully.
      -- Somersault once in the sea! -- exclaimed the Mock Turtle and cartwheeled on the sand.
      -- Change lobsters again! -- cried the Gryphon at the top of his voice.
      “And you’re going back to the shore! That’s the whole first figure,” said the Mock Turtle, his voice suddenly falling. And the two friends, who had just been jumping around on the sand like madmen, became sad, sat down and looked longingly at Alice.
      “It must be a very beautiful dance,” Alice remarked timidly.
      “Would you like to see it?” asked the Mock Turtle.
      “Very,” said Alice.
      “Get up,” said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. “Let’s show her the first figure. It doesn’t matter that there are no lobsters here... We can do without them. Who will sing?
      ” “You sing,” said the Gryphon. “I don’t remember the words.”
      And they danced importantly around Alice, nodding their heads in time and not noticing that they kept stepping on her feet. The Mock Turtle began to sing a sad song.

      The cod says to the snail: “Hurry up, my friend, come!”
      A dolphin steps on my tail - it's trailing behind.
      You see, crabs, turtles, They rush to the sea past us.
      Today we have a ball on the seashore, will you come and dance with us?
      Do you want to, can you, can you, do you want to start dancing with us?

      You don’t know how pleasant, how amusing it is to be a cod,
      If we are thrown into the sea and the sea wave carries us away! '
      ' Oh! -- the snail squeaked. -- They will throw us far away!
      I don’t want to, I can’t, I don’t want to dance with you.
      I can’t, I don’t want to, I can’t start dancing! '

      ' Ah, what is far? -- answered the cod. --
      Where England is far, France is close.
      Many miles from the shores there are shores again.
      Don’t be shy, my snail, and come dance with me.
      Do you want to, can you, can you, do you want to come and dance with me?
      "Can you, will you, will you, will you come and dance with me?" "

      Thank you very much," said Alice, glad that the dance was at last over. "It was very interesting to see. And I liked the song about the cod very much! Such a funny...
      " "By the way, about the cod," began the Mock Turtle. "You've seen it, of course?
      " "Yes," said Alice. "It sometimes came to dinner with us. "
      She paused, looking frightened, but the Mock Turtle was not embarrassed.
      "I don't know what you mean," remarked the Mock Turtle, "but since you've met so often, of course you know what it looks like...
      " "Yes, I think I do," said Alice thoughtfully. "It's got its tail in its mouth, and is all covered in breadcrumbs.
      " "You're mistaken about the breadcrumbs," objected the Mock Turtle. -- The biscuits would have washed away into the sea anyway... Well, her tail, however, is in her mouth. The fact is that...
      Here the Mock Turtle yawned widely and closed his eyes.
      -- Explain to her about her tail, -- he said to the Gryphon.
      -- The fact is, -- said the Gryphon, -- she is very fond of dancing with the lobsters. So they throw her into the sea. So she flies far, far away. So her tail gets stuck in her mouth - so tightly that you can’t get it out. That’s all.
      -- Thank you, -- said Alice. -- That’s very interesting. I didn’t know any of this about cod.
      -- If you like, -- said the Gryphon, -- I can tell you a lot more about cod! Do you know why they call it cod?
      -- I never thought of that, -- answered Alice. -- Why?
      -- Lots of cod, -- the Gryphon said significantly.
      Alice was confused.
      -- Lots of cod? -- she repeated in bewilderment.
      "Well, yes," the Gryphon confirmed. "It's not much of a fish, not much use, but it's a lot of cod."
      Alice was silent and just looked at the Gryphon with wide eyes.
      “She’s very fond of talking,” continued the Gryphon. “When she starts chattering, you’re ready to run away. And she’s picked out friends just like her. There’s an old man named Zander who comes to see her. He gossips from morning till night! And then there’s the Pike, who runs in and pikes everyone. There’s also the Catfish, who doubts everything... And when they all get together, they make such a noise that your head goes spinning... Do you know the Beluga?”
      Alice nodded.
      “So they drove her crazy. She just can’t get over it, poor thing. She just roars and roars...
      ” “That’s why they say, ‘Roars like a Beluga’?” Alice asked timidly.
      “Well, yes,” said the Gryphon. “That’s why.”
      Then the Mock Turtle opened his eyes.
      “Well, that’s enough about that,” he said. “Now tell me about your adventures.”
      "I shall be glad to tell you all that has happened to me since this morning," said Alice hesitantly. "But I won't tell you anything about yesterday, because I was quite different then.
      " "Explain yourself," said the Mock Turtle.
      "No, the adventures first," interrupted the Gryphon impatiently. "It would take a long time to explain.
      " And Alice began to tell all that had happened to her since the moment she saw the White Rabbit. At first she felt a little uneasy, the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle moving so close to her, and opening their eyes and mouths so wide; but then she grew bolder. The Gryphon and the Mock Turtle were silent until she came to meeting the Blue Caterpillar and trying to read "Papa William" to it. Then the Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and said,
      "Very strange!
      " "Certainly strange!" said the Gryphon.
      "All the wrong words," said the Mock Turtle thoughtfully. --I wish she would read us something. Tell her to begin.
      And he looked at the Gryphon, as if it had power over Alice.
      -- Get up and read "It's the Voice of an Idle Person," -- the Gryphon ordered Alice.
      -- How they all love to boss people around here, -- thought Alice. -- They do nothing but make us read. You'd think I was at school.
      Still, she got up obediently and began to read. But her thoughts were so occupied with lobsters and a sea quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying. The words came out very queer indeed.

      It's the voice of an Idle Person. Do you hear the cry?
      -- You've boiled me! Oh, where's my wig?
      And, adjusting his waistcoat and bow with his nose,
      he walks on tiptoe, like a London dandy.

      If the sandbank is deserted and quiet all around,
      He shouts that sharks don't bother him,
      But as soon as he spots sharks in the distance,
      He hides in the sand and shouts "Help!"

      "It's not at all like what I read when I was a child," said the Gryphon.
      "I never heard of those poems," said the Mock Turtle. "But, to tell you the truth, it's awful nonsense!"
      Alice said nothing; she sat down on the sand and covered her face with her hands; she could hardly believe that everything could ever be as it was before.
      "She can't explain it," said the Gryphon quickly.
      And turning to Alice, he added:
      "Go on.
      " "Why does he walk on his toes?" asked the Mock Turtle. "Explain that to me, at least.
      " "It's a dancing position," said Alice. But she didn't understand it herself; she didn't want to talk about it any more.
      "Go on then," said the Gryphon hurriedly. -- ``I was walking through the garden one day...''
      Alice did not dare disobey, although she was sure that everything would turn out wrong again, and in a trembling voice she continued:

      I was walking through the garden one day, and suddenly saw
      How an Owl and a Jackal were dividing a gingerbread cake.
      And the Jackal swallowed the gingerbread cake whole,
      And gave the Owl only a saucer with a rim.

      And then he offered her: ``Let's finish dividing -
      You take yourself a spoon, I'll take a fork and knife.''
      And, having eaten his fill, the Jackal lay down on the grass,
      But first, for dessert, he swallowed ...

      - Why read all this nonsense, - interrupted her the Mock Tail, - if you still can't explain anything? I never heard such gibberish in my life!
      - Yes, I think that's enough, - said the Gryphon, to Alice's great joy.
      "Shall we dance again?" continued the Gryphon. "Or should I have the Mock Turtle sing you a song?
      " "A song, if I may," answered Alice with such fervor that the Gryphon only shrugged his shoulders. "       There's no accounting for taste," he remarked offendedly
      . "Sing her `The Evening Meal,' old man."
      The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and, sobbing, began to sing:       Evening Meal

      , beloved Sea Soup!
      When you shine, green and thick, - Who will not inhale, who will not understand you then,       Evening Meal, blessed Meal! Evening Meal,       blessed Meal!       Blissful Meal! Blissful Meal!       Evening Meal,       Blissful, blessed Meal!       Evening Meal! Who, contrary to his heart,       Will ask for salmon and demand cod?       We will forget everything for you,       this blessed Food given almost for free!       This blessed Food given for free!       Blessed Food!       Blessed Food!       Evening food,       Blessed, blessed Food!




















      -- Repeat the chorus! -- said the Gryphon.
      The Mock Turtle opened his mouth, but at that moment a voice in the distance said:
      -- The trial is in session!
      -- Run! -- said the Gryphon, seizing Alice by the hand and dragging her along, without listening to the end of the song.
      -- Who is on trial? -- asked Alice, breathlessly.
      But the Gryphon only repeated:
      -- Run! Run! --
      And he quickened his pace.
      And the breeze from the sea brought a sad tune:

      Evening meal,
      Blessed, blessed meal!

      It sounded softer and softer, and at last died away altogether.
Chapter XI. WHO STOLE THE PRETZELS?


Fig. 8


      The King and Queen of Hearts were sitting on the throne, and around them were gathered the rest of the cards and a crowd of all sorts of birds and little animals. In front of the throne stood the Knave in chains between two soldiers. The White Rabbit was hovering near the King, holding a trumpet in one hand and a long scroll of parchment in the other. In the middle stood a table, and on the table was a large dish of pretzels. They looked so appetizing that Alice’s mouth practically watered.
      “I wish they’d finish the trial,” she thought, “and serve the refreshments.”
      However, there was little hope of this, and she began to look around to while away the time.
      Alice had never been in a court of law before, although she had read about it in books. She was very pleased that almost everything here was familiar to her.
      “There’s the judge,” she said to herself. “If he’s wearing a wig, then he’s a judge.”
      The judge, by the way, was the King himself, and as he had to put his crown on his wig (look at the frontispiece to see how he did it), he didn't feel very confident. Besides, it wasn't very pretty.
      'These are the jury-boxes,' thought Alice. 'And these twelve creatures' (she had to use the word, because there were some little animals and some birds) 'must be the jury.
      ' She repeated the last word to herself two or three times; she was very proud of knowing such a difficult word; there weren't many girls her age, Alice thought (and she was right) who knew what it meant. 'Jurors' might as well be called them.
      The jurymen were scribbling rapidly on their slates.
      'What are they writing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. "But the trial hasn't begun yet.
      " "They're writing down their names," whispered the Gryphon. "They're afraid they'll forget them before the trial's over.
      " "Oh, silly people!" said Alice indignantly, but at that very moment the White Rabbit cried out,
      "Don't make any noise in the court!"
      And the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously into the court, as if he wanted to know who was making the noise. Alice stopped talking.
      From where she sat she could see, as clearly as if she were standing behind them, that the jurymen immediately began writing "Oh, silly people!"
      She even noticed that one of them didn't know how to spell "silly" and had to ask the person next to him.
      "I can't imagine what they'll write before the trial's over!" thought Alice.
      One of the jurors had a pencil that kept squeaking. Alice couldn't bear it, of course; so she went up and stood behind him; and, seizing a favourable moment, she deftly snatched the pencil away. She did all this so quickly that the poor juror (it was little Bill) did not understand what had happened; he looked for the pencil and tried to write with his finger. This was of little use, as his finger left no trace on the slate.
      "Clerk, read the indictment!" said the King.
      The White Rabbit blew his trumpet three times, unrolled a scroll of parchment, and read:

      The Queen of Hearts baked some pretzels
      On a fine summer's day.
      The Knave of Hearts was the cleverest of all,
      And carried off seven pretzels.

      "Think over your decision!" said the King to the jury.
      "No, no," said the Rabbit quickly, "it is too early." Everything must be done according to the rules.
      “Call the first witness,” ordered the King.
      The White Rabbit blew his trumpet three times and shouted,
      “First witness!”
      The first witness was the Hatter. He walked up to the throne, holding a cup of tea in one hand and a sandwich in the other.
      “I beg your pardon, Your Majesty,” he began, “for coming here with a cup. But I was just having my tea when they came for me. Before I could finish—
      ” “I might have,” said the King. “When did you begin?”
      The Hatter glanced at the March Hare, who was walking behind him, arm in arm with the Dormouse.
      “The fourteenth of March, I think,” he said.
      “The fifteenth,” said the March Hare.
      “The sixteenth,” murmured the Dormouse.
      "Write it down," said the King to the jury, and they quickly wrote down the three dates on their slates, and then added them up and converted them into shillings and pence.
      "Take off your hat," said the King to the Hatter.
      "It's not mine," replied the Hatter.
      "It's stolen!" cried the King triumphantly, turning to the jury, who immediately took up their slates.
      "I keep them for sale," explained the Hatter. "I haven't any of my own, being a Hatter.
      " Here the Queen put on her spectacles and looked straight at the Hatter, who turned pale and shifted from one foot to the other.
      "Give your evidence," said the King, "and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on the spot."
      This did not cheer the Hatter very much: he stamped his feet, looking fearfully at the Queen, and in confusion bit off a piece of his cup instead of a sandwich.
      At that moment Alice felt somehow strange. She could not understand what was happening to her, but finally it dawned on her: she was growing again! At first she wanted to get up and leave the courtroom, but after thinking it over, she decided to stay and sit as long as there was enough room for her.
      “Could you not be so insistent?” asked the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. “I can hardly breathe.
      ” “I can’t help it,” said Alice guiltily. “I’m growing.
      ” “You have no right to grow here,” remarked the Dormouse.
      “Nonsense,” answered Alice, emboldened. “You know perfectly well that you are growing yourself.
      ” “Yes, but I am growing at a decent rate,” objected the Dormouse, “not like some others... It’s simply ridiculous, growing like that!”
      She pouted, got up and crossed to the other side of the courtroom.
      Meanwhile the Queen was still looking fixedly at the Hatter, and before the Dormouse had time to sit down, the Queen frowned and ordered:
      “Bring me the list of those who sang at the last concert!”
      Here the poor Hatter began to tremble so much that both his shoes flew off his feet.
      “Give me your evidence,” repeated the King angrily, “or I’ll have you executed. I don’t care whether you’re nervous or not!
      ” “I’m a little man,” said the Hatter in a trembling voice, “and I haven’t had time to drink my tea... it’s only a week since I began... I’ve almost run out of bread and butter... and I kept thinking about the owl above us, which, like a tray above the sky...
      ” “About what?” asked the King.
      “A tray... above the sky...
      ” “Well, of course,” said the King sternly, “under the breath is one thing, but above the sky is quite another! Do you take me for a fool? Go on!”
      “I am a little man,” continued the Hatter, “and only after that everything began to twinkle before my eyes... only suddenly the March Hare said...
      ” “I said nothing,” interrupted the March Hare quickly.
      “Yes, I did,” objected the Hatter.
      “I never thought of it,” said the March Hare. “I deny everything!
      ” “He denies everything,” said the King. “Don’t put it in the record!
      ” “Well, then, the Dormouse said it,” continued the Hatter, looking anxiously at the Dormouse. But the Dormouse did not deny anything; she was fast asleep.
      “Then I cut myself some more bread,” continued the Hatter, “and buttered it...
      ” “But what did the Dormouse say?” asked one of the jurors.
      “I don’t remember,” said the Hatter.
      “Try to remember,” said the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”
      The unfortunate Hatter dropped his cup and sandwich and sank to one knee.
      "I'm a little man," he repeated. "And I was thinking about the owl...
      " "You're an owl yourself," said the King.
      Here one of the guinea-pigs applauded loudly and was suppressed. (As this is a difficult word, I will explain to you what it means. The attendants took a large bag, put the pig in it head down, tied the bag up, and sat down on it.)
      "I'm so glad I saw how it's done," thought Alice. "I've so often read in the papers: 'Attempts at resistance were suppressed...' Now I know what it is!
      " "Now that's enough," said the King to the Hatter. "Cut it out!
      " "I'm all round as it is," retorted the Hatter joyfully. "My hats are round, and my dummy hats too...
      " "You're a round dummy, that's what you are!" said the King.
      Here another pig applauded and was suppressed.
      “Well, that’s all about the pigs,” thought Alice. “Now things will be more fun.” “
      You are free to go,” said the King to the Hatter.
      And the Hatter ran out of the courtroom, not even bothering to put on his shoes.
      “And cut off his head there in the street,” added the Queen, turning to one of the attendants.
      But the Hatter was already far away.
      “Call a witness,” ordered the King.
      The witness turned out to be the cook. She was holding a pepper-box in her hand. Before she had entered the courtroom, those sitting near the door suddenly sneezed. Alice guessed at once who was about to enter.
      “Give me your evidence,” said the King.
      “I wouldn’t dream of it,” answered the cook.
      The King looked puzzled at the White Rabbit.
      “Your Majesty will have to cross-examine her,” whispered the Rabbit.
      “Well, if it’s a cross, then it’s a cross,” sighed the King, crossing his arms over his chest and, frowning menacingly, squinted his eyes so that Alice was frightened. At last the King asked in a hollow voice:
      “What are pretzels made of?
      ” “Pepper, mostly,” answered the cook.
      “Jelly,” said a sleepy voice behind her.
      “Get that Dormouse!” screamed the Queen. “Cut off her head! Drive her out by the neck! Choke her! Pinch her! Cut off her moustache!”
      Everybody rushed to catch the Dormouse. There was a commotion, and when at last everyone had sat down again, the cook had disappeared.
      “That’s good,” said the King with relief. “Call the next witness!”
      And, turning to the Queen, he said in a low voice:
      “Now, my dear, you cross-examine her yourself.” Otherwise, I have a headache.
      The White Rabbit rustled the list.
      “I wonder who they’ll call now,” thought Alice. “They haven’t got any clues yet...”
      Imagine her surprise when the White Rabbit screamed in his thin, shrill voice:
      “Alice!”
Chapter XII. ALICE TESTIFIES


      "Here!" cried Alice, forgetting in her excitement how tall she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up from her seat so quickly that she caught the edge of her skirt on the jury-box, which overturned, and all the jurors fell down on the heads of the seated audience. There they lay, reminding Alice of the fishes that had lain helpless on the floor about a week ago, when she had accidentally upset the fish-bowl.
      "I beg your pardon!" cried Alice sadly, and began hastily to select the jury; the incident of the fish-bowl was still on her mind, and for some reason it seemed to her that unless the jurymen were selected as quickly as possible and seated again on the bench, they would certainly perish.
      "The court will not proceed until all the jurors are back in their places," said the King sternly.
      "I repeat: all! Every single one!" -- he said slowly, without taking his eyes off Alice.
      Alice looked at the jury and discovered that in her haste she had placed Bill the Lizard on the bench upside down; the poor fellow was wagging his tail sadly, but could not turn over. She quickly picked him up and sat him down properly.
      But to herself she thought:
      -- Of course, it doesn’t matter at all. Upside down or down, he’s no use in court.
      As soon as the jury had recovered their composure a little and had recovered the slates and slates they had lost in the fall, they began busily writing out the history of the incident. Bill alone sat motionless, his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed on the sky: apparently he could not come to his senses.
      -- What do you know about this case? -- asked the King.
      -- Nothing, -- answered Alice.
      -- Nothing at all? -- the King persisted.
      -- Nothing at all, -- repeated Alice.
      -- It is very important, -- said the King, turning to the jury.
      They rushed to write, but at this point the White Rabbit intervened.
      “Your Majesty means, of course, ‘It doesn’t matter,’” he said respectfully. However, he frowned and made signs to the King.
      “Oh, yes,” said the King quickly. “That’s exactly what I meant. It doesn’t matter! Of course it doesn’t matter! ”
      And he muttered under his breath, as if trying to decide which sounded best.
      “It matters—it doesn’t matter… it matters—it matters…
      ” Some of the jury wrote down “It matters!” and others “It doesn’t matter!” Alice was standing so close that she could see everything perfectly.
      “It doesn’t matter at all,” she thought.
      At that moment the King, who was writing something quickly in his note-book, called out,
      “Quiet!”
      He looked into the book and read:
      -- ``Rule 42. Anybody over a mile high must leave the room at once!''
      And everyone stared at Alice.
      ``I haven't got a mile in me,'' said Alice.
      ``Yes, I do,'' said the King.
      ``You're at least two miles high,'' added the Queen.
      ``I'm not going anywhere,'' said Alice. ``Anyway, it's not a real rule. You've just made it up.
      '' ``It's the oldest rule in the book,'' said the King.
      ``Then why is it the 42nd?'' asked Alice. ``It ought to be the first!''
      The King turned pale and closed the book hastily.
      ``Consider your decision,'' he said to the jury in a low, trembling voice.
      The White Rabbit jumped up from his seat.
      ``With your Majesty's permission,'' he said, ``there are some more clues here. A document has just been found.
      '' ``What's in it?'' asked the Queen.
      “I have not read it yet,” answered the White Rabbit, “but, in my opinion, it is a letter from the accused... to someone...
      ” “Of course, to someone,” said the King. “I don’t think he wrote the letter to anyone. Such things are not usually done.
      ” “Whom is it addressed to?” asked one of the jurors.
      “Nobody,” answered the White Rabbit. “Anyway, there is nothing written on the back.”
      With these words, he unfolded the letter and added:
      “It is not even a letter, but a poem.
      ” “In the accused’s handwriting?” asked another juror.
      “No,” answered the White Rabbit. “And that is the most suspicious thing of all.”
      (The jurors were at a loss.)
      “Then he forged the handwriting,” remarked the King.
      (The jurors brightened.)
      “With Your Majesty’s permission,” said the Knave, “I did not write this letter, and they will not prove it. There is no signature.
      ” “So much the worse,” said the King. “Then you’re up to something bad, or you’d have signed your name like all honest people.”
      Everyone applauded: for the first time that day the King had said something really clever.
      “He’s proven guilty,” said the Queen. “Chop him—”
      “Not at all!” said Alice. “You don’t even know what poetry is about.
      ” “Read it!” said the King to the Rabbit.
      The Rabbit put on his spectacles.
      “Where shall I begin, Your Majesty?” he asked.
      “Begin at the beginning,” answered the King gravely, “and go on till you get to the end. When you get to the end, finish!”
      There was a dead silence. This is what the White Rabbit read:

      I know you talked to her,
      And to him, of course.
      She said, “Very nice,
      but he can't swim.

      This one and that one have been there
      (That everybody knows),
      But if the case had been pursued,
      You would have been responsible.

      I gave them three, they gave us five,
      You promised them six.
      But they all came back to you again,
      Though they were mine.

      You and she were not involved
      In such an evil deed,
      Though he once said
      That they were tired of everything.

      She is, of course, hot-tempered,
      Don't argue with me in vain.
      Yes, you see, cutting off the shoulder
      Is not so safe.

      But he must not know about it
      (Don't blurt it out by chance),
      All the others are innocent,
      And that is our secret.

      "This is a very important clue," said the King, rubbing his hands. "Everything we have heard today pales in comparison with it. And now let the jury consider their - "
      But Alice did not let him finish.
      "If any of them can explain these verses to me," said Alice, "I will give them sixpence. (She had grown even bigger in the last few minutes, and now she was no longer afraid of anyone.) -- I am sure there is no meaning in them!
      The jury wrote down: ``She is sure there is no meaning in them,'' but none of them made any attempt to explain the verses.
      -- If there is no meaning in them, -- said the King, -- so much the better. There is no need to try to explain them. However...
      Here he put the verses on his knees, looked at them with one eye and said:
      -- However, I think I can explain some of them, ``...but it can't swim...''
      And, turning to the Knave, the King asked:
      -- You can't swim, can you?
      The Knave shook his head sadly.
      -- Of course I can! -- he said. (That was true - after all, it was paper.)
      -- So, -- said the King and bent over the verses again.
      ``...Everyone in the world knows'' - this he, of course, about the jury. ``I gave them three, they gave us five...'' So that's what he did with the pretzels!
      ``But it says there that "they all came back to you again,"'' said Alice.
      ``Of course they did,'' cried the King, pointing triumphantly to the dish of pretzels on the table. ``That's obvious!'' ``She's certainly hot...'' he muttered, and looked at the Queen. ``Are you hot, my dear?''
      “Oh, no, I am unusually reserved,” answered the Queen, and threw the inkwell at Little Bill. (The poor fellow had given up writing on the board with his finger, having discovered that he was leaving no trace on the board, but now he hastened to write again, dipping his finger in the ink running down his face.)
      “Cut off the shoulder...” read the King and looked at the Queen again. “Do you ever cut off the shoulder, my dear?
      ” “Never,” answered the Queen.
      And, turning away, she cried, pointing her finger at poor Bill:
      “Cut off his head! His head from the shoulders!
      ” “Ah-ah, I see,” said the King. “With us, you cut off from the shoulders, not from the shoulder! ”
      And he looked around with a smile. Everyone was silent.
      “It’s a pun!” cried the King angrily.
      And everyone laughed.
      "Let the jury decide whether he is guilty or not," said the King for the twentieth time that day.
      "No!" said the Queen. "Let them pass sentence! And whether he is guilty or not, we will see later!
      " "Nonsense!" said Alice loudly. "How could anyone think of such a thing!
      " "Silence!" cried the Queen, turning purple.
      "I don't think so," answered Alice.
      "Off with her head!" shouted the Queen at the top of her voice.
      Nobody moved.
      "Who are you afraid of?" said Alice. (She had now grown to her usual height.) "You are only a pack of cards!"
      Then all the cards rose into the air and flew into Alice's face. She gave a cry, half frightened, half angry, and began to fight them off... and found herself lying on the bank, her head on her sister's lap, and her sister was quietly brushing dry leaves that had fallen from the tree from her face.
      -- Alice, dear, wake up! -- said her sister. -- How long you have slept!
      -- What a strange dream I had! -- said Alice, and she told her sister everything she remembered about her wonderful adventures, which you have just read about.
      And when she had finished, her sister kissed her and said:
      -- It really was a very strange dream! And now run home, or you will be late for tea.
      Alice jumped to her feet and ran. And while she was running, she kept wondering what kind of wonderful dream she had had.
      And her sister remained sitting on the bank. She leaned on her hand, looked at the setting sun, and thought about little Alice and her wonderful adventures, until she fell into a half-sleep. And this is what she saw.
      First she saw Alice, again with the little arms round her knees, again with the big shining eyes looking up at her. She heard her voice, and saw Alice shaking her head to get the hair out of her eyes. She listened: everything around her seemed to be alive, and the strange creatures she had dreamed of seemed to surround her.
      The long grass at her feet rustled as the White Rabbit ran past; a frightened Mouse splashed across the pond nearby; there was a clatter of dishes as the March Hare gave his friends endless tea; the Queen screamed shrilly, 'Off with his head!' Again the baby sneezed in the Duchess's lap, and the plates and saucers whistled around her; Once again she heard the Gryphon's cry in the air, the scraping of a slate, the squeal of a suppressed pig, and the distant sobbing of the unfortunate Mock Turtle.
      And so she sat with her eyes closed, imagining that she, too, had entered Wonderland, though she knew that if she opened them, everything around her would become familiar and ordinary again; only the wind would rustle the grass, drive ripples across the pond, and shake the reeds; the clink of dishes would turn into the tinkle of a sheep's bell, the shrill voice of the Queen into the cry of a shepherd, the cry of the baby and the cry of the Gryphon into the noise of a barnyard, and the wailing of the Mock Turtle (she knew it) would merge with the distant lowing of the cows.
      And finally, she imagined her little sister growing up and, retaining into her mature years the simple and loving heart of a child, would gather other children around her, and how their eyes would sparkle with wonderful stories. Perhaps she will tell them about Wonderland and, sharing with them their simple sorrows and simple joys, will remember her childhood and happy summer days.

      THE END
